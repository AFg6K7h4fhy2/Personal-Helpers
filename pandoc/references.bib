	abstract = {Until the recent outbreaks, Ebola vaccines ranked low in decision makers’ priority lists based on costeffectiveness analysis and (or) corporate proﬁtability. Despite a relatively small number of Ebolarelated cases and deaths (compared to other causes), Ebola vaccines suddenly leapt to highest priority among international health agencies and vaccine developers. Clearly, earlier cost-effectiveness analyses badly missed some factors affecting real world decisions. Multi-criteria systems analysis can improve evaluation and prioritization of vaccine development and also of many other health policy and investment decisions. Neither cost-effectiveness nor cost-beneﬁt analysis can capture important aspects of problems such as Ebola or the emerging threat of Zika, especially issues of inequality and disparity—issues that dominate the planning of many global health and economic organizations. Cost-beneﬁt analysis requires assumptions about the speciﬁc value of life—an idea objectionable to many analysts and policy makers. Additionally, standard cost-effectiveness calculations cannot generally capture effects on people uninfected with Ebola for example, but nevertheless affected through such factors as contagion, herd immunity, and fear of dread disease, reduction of travel and commerce, and even the hope of disease eradication. Using SMART Vaccines, we demonstrate how systems analysis can visibly include important ‘‘other factors” and more usefully guide decision making and beneﬁcially alter priority setting processes.

	abstract = {Differential equations-based epidemic compartmental models and deep neural networks-based artificial intelligence (AI) models are powerful tools for analyzing and fighting the transmission of COVID-19. However, the capability of compartmental models is limited by the challenges of parameter estimation, while AI models fail to discover the evolutionary pattern of COVID-19 and lack explainability. This paper aims to provide a novel method (called Epi-DNNs) by integrating compartmental models and deep neural networks (DNNs) to model the complex dynamics of COVID-19. In the proposed Epi-DNNs method, the neural network is designed to express the unknown parameters in the compartmental model and the Runge–Kutta method is implemented to solve the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) so as to give the values of the ODEs at a given time. Specifically, the discrepancy between predictions and observations is incorporated into the loss function, then the defined loss is minimized and applied to identify the best-fitted parameters governing the compartmental model. Furthermore, we verify the performance of Epi-DNNs on the real-world reported COVID-19 data on the Omicron epidemic in Shanghai covering February 25 to May 27, 2022. The experimental findings on the synthesized data have revealed its effectiveness in COVID-19 transmission modeling. Moreover, the inferred parameters from the proposed Epi-DNNs method yield a predictive compartmental model, which can serve to forecast future dynamics.},

The SIR model is the archetype of widely used compartmental models for epidemics. It is sometimes forgotten, that Kermack and McKendrick introduced the SIR model as a special case of a more general framework. This general framework distinguishes individuals not only by whether they are susceptible, infected or removed, but additionally tracks the time passed since they got infected. Such time-since-infection models can mechanistically link within-host dynamics to the population level. This allows the models to account for more details of the disease dynamics, such as delays of infectiousness and symptoms during the onset of an infection. Details like this can be vital for interpreting epidemiological data.},

We illustrate this point in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. Policy responses all over the world aim to reduce social interaction and limit contagion. Using data on human mobility and political trust at regional level in Europe, we examine whether the compliance to these containment policies depends on the level of trust in policy makers prior to the crisis. Using a double difference approach around the time of lockdown announcements, we ﬁnd that high-trust regions decrease their mobility related to non-necessary activities signiﬁcantly more than low-trust regions. We also exploit country and time variation in treatment using the daily strictness of national policies. The efﬁciency of policy stringency in terms of mobility reduction signiﬁcantly increases with trust. The trust effect is nonlinear and increases with the degree of stringency. We assess how the impact of trust on mobility potentially translates in terms of mortality growth rate.},

	abstract = {In a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, the initial speed at which infected cases increase is indicative of the long-term trajectory of the outbreak. Yet during real-world outbreaks, individuals may modify their behavior and take preventative steps to reduce infection risk. As a consequence, the relationship between the initial rate of spread and the final case count may become tenuous. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis by comparing the dynamics arising from a simple SIR epidemic model with those from a modified SIR model in which individuals reduce contacts as a function of the current or cumulative number of cases. Dynamics with behavior change exhibit significantly reduced final case counts even though the initial speed of disease spread is nearly identical for both of the models. We show that this difference in final size projections depends critically in the behavior change of individuals. These results also provide a rationale for integrating behavior change into iterative forecast models. Hence, we propose to use a Kalman filter to update models with and without behavior change as part of iterative forecasts. When the ground truth outbreak includes behavior change, sequential predictions using a simple SIR model perform poorly despite repeated observations while predictions using the modified SIR model are able to correct for initial forecast errors. These findings highlight the value of incorporating behavior change into baseline epidemic and dynamic forecast models.},

	abstract = {For decades, mathematical models of disease transmission have provided researchers and public health ofﬁcials with critical insights into the progression, control, and prevention of disease spread. Of these models, one of the most fundamental is the SIR differential equation model. However, this ubiquitous model has one signiﬁcant and rarely acknowledged shortcoming: it is unable to account for a disease's true infectious period distribution. As the misspeciﬁcation of such a biological characteristic is known to signiﬁcantly affect model behavior, there is a need to develop new modeling approaches that capture such information. Therefore, we illustrate an innovative take on compartmental models, derived from their general formulation as systems of nonlinear Volterra integral equations, to capture a broader range of infectious period distributions, yet maintain the desirable formulation as systems of differential equations. Our work illustrates a compartmental model that captures any Erlang distributed duration of infection with only 3 differential equations, instead of the typical inﬂated model sizes required by traditional differential equation compartmental models, and a compartmental model that captures any mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of an infectious period distribution with 4 differential equations. The signiﬁcance of our work is that it opens up a new class of easyto-use compartmental models to predict disease outbreaks that do not require a complete overhaul of existing theory, and thus provides a starting point for multiple research avenues of investigation under the contexts of mathematics, public health, and evolutionary biology.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological modelling can be a powerful tool to assist animal health policy development and disease prevention and control. Models can vary from simple deterministic mathematical models through to complex spatially-explicit stochastic simulations and decision support systems. The approach used will vary depending on the purpose of the study, how well the epidemiology of a disease is understood, the amount and quality of data available, and the background and experience of the modellers. Epidemiological models can be classified into various categories depending on their treatment of variability, chance and uncertainty (deterministic or stochastic), time (continuous or discrete intervals), space (non-spatial or spatial) and the structure of the population (homogeneous or heterogeneous mixing). The increasing sophistication of computers, together with greater recognition of the importance of spatial elements in the spread and control of disease, mean that models which incorporate spatial components are becoming more important in epidemiological studies. Multidisciplinary approaches using a range of new technologies make it possible to build more sophisticated models of animal disease. New generation epidemiological models enable disease to be studied in the context of physical, economic, technological, health, media and political infrastructures. To be useful in policy development, models must be fit for purpose and appropriately verified and validated. This involves ensuring that the model is an adequate representation of the system under study and that its outputs are sufficiently accurate and precise for the intended purpose. Finally, models are just one tool for providing technical advice, and should not be considered in isolation from data from experimental and field studies.},

Due to various unpredictable factors, including population migration, vaccination, control eﬀorts, and seasonal ﬂuctuations, traditional epidemic models that rely on prior knowledge of virus transmission mechanisms may not be suﬃcient to forecast complex epidemics like coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19). The application of traditional epidemiological models such as susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) may face diﬃculties in accurately predicting such complex epidemics. Data-driven prediction approaches lack the ability to generalize and exhibit low accuracy on small datasets due to their reliance on large amounts of data without incorporating prior knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a ﬂexible ensemble data-driven framework (Neural-SEIR) that “neuralizes” the SEIR model by approximating the core parameters through neural networks while preserving the propagation structure of SEIR. NeuralSEIR employs long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to capture complex correlation features, exponential smoothing (ES) to model seasonal information, and prior knowledge from SEIR. By incorporating SEIR parameters into the neural network structure, Neural-SEIR leverages prior knowledge while updating parameters with real-world data. Our experimental results demonstrate that Neural-SEIR outperforms traditional machine learning and epidemiological models, achieving high prediction accuracy and eﬃciency in forecasting epidemic diseases.},

The deep learning framework utilizes the hidden physics of infectious diseases and infer the latent quantities of interest in the model by approximating them using deep neural networks. The performance of the deep learning method is validated against representative small and big data sets corresponding to a well-known benchmark example and the results indicate that deep learning is a viable candidate to determine model parameters. The paper also presents the need for researchers to understand different types of dependencies exhibited in a typical data set and discovering the most appropriate approaches for statistical inference.

We start from the basic concepts and models in an unstructured population and gradually increase the realism by adding the effects of realistic contact structures within a population as well as the effects of human mobility coupling different subpopulations. Building on these concepts we present two realistic data-driven epidemiological models able to forecast the spreading of infectious diseases at different geographical granularities.

	abstract = {Background: The potential impact of an influenza pandemic can be assessed by calculating a set of transmissibility parameters, the most important being the reproduction number (R), which is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated per typical infectious case.Methods: We conducted a systematic review to summarize published estimates of R for pandemic or seasonal influenza and for novel influenza viruses (e.g. H5N1). We retained and summarized papers that estimated R for pandemic or seasonal influenza or for human infections with novel influenza viruses.Results: The search yielded 567 papers. Ninety-one papers were retained, and an additional twenty papers were identified from the references of the retained papers. Twenty-four studies reported 51 R values for the 1918 pandemic. The median R value for 1918 was 1.80 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.47–2.27). Six studies reported seven 1957 pandemic R values. The median R value for 1957 was 1.65 (IQR: 1.53–1.70). Four studies reported seven 1968 pandemic R values. The median R value for 1968 was 1.80 (IQR: 1.56–1.85). Fifty-seven studies reported 78 2009 pandemic R values. The median R value for 2009 was 1.46 (IQR: 1.30–1.70) and was similar across the two waves of illness: 1.46 for the first wave and 1.48 for the second wave. Twenty-four studies reported 47 seasonal epidemic R values. The median R value for seasonal influenza was 1.28 (IQR: 1.19–1.37). Four studies reported six novel influenza R values. Four out of six R values were {\textless}1. Conclusions: These R values represent the difference between epidemics that are controllable and cause moderate illness and those causing a significant number of illnesses and requiring intensive mitigation strategies to control. Continued monitoring of R during seasonal and novel influenza outbreaks is needed to document its variation before the next pandemic.},

Using an implementation of data-informed geometry learning we directly reconstruct the relevant “normal forms”: a quantitative mapping from empirical observations to prototypical realizations of the underlying dynamics. Interestingly, the state variables and the parameters of these realizations are inferred from the empirical observations; without prior knowledge or understanding, they parametrize the dynamics intrinsically, without explicit reference to fundamental physical quantities.},

	abstract = {Background: The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic has clearly shown the importance of considering the long-range transportation networks in the understanding of emerging diseases outbreaks. The introduction of extensive transportation data sets is therefore an important step in order to develop epidemic models endowed with realism. Methods: We develop a general stochastic meta-population model that incorporates actual travel and census data among 3 100 urban areas in 220 countries. The model allows probabilistic predictions on the likelihood of country outbreaks and their magnitude. The level of predictability offered by the model can be quantitatively analyzed and related to the appearance of robust epidemic pathways that represent the most probable routes for the spread of the disease. Results: In order to assess the predictive power of the model, the case study of the global spread of SARS is considered. The disease parameter values and initial conditions used in the model are evaluated from empirical data for Hong Kong. The outbreak likelihood for specific countries is evaluated along with the emerging epidemic pathways. Simulation results are in agreement with the empirical data of the SARS worldwide epidemic. Conclusion: The presented computational approach shows that the integration of long-range mobility and demographic data provides epidemic models with a predictive power that can be consistently tested and theoretically motivated. This computational strategy can be therefore considered as a general tool in the analysis and forecast of the global spreading of emerging diseases and in the definition of containment policies aimed at reducing the effects of potentially catastrophic outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Background: Influenza vaccines are most effective when the antigens in the vaccine match those of circulating strains. However, antigens contained in the vaccines do not always match circulating strains. In the present work we aimed to examine the vaccine efficacy (VE) afforded by influenza vaccines when they are not well matched to circulating strains. Methods: We identified randomized clinical trials (RCTs) through MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and references of included RCTs. RCTs reporting laboratory-confirmed influenza among healthy participants vaccinated with antigens of matching and non-matching influenza strains were included. Two independent reviewers screened citations/full-text articles, abstracted data, and appraised risk of bias. Conflicts were resolved by discussion. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted. VE was calculated using the following formula: (1 - relative risk × 100\%). Results: We included 34 RCTs, providing data on 47 influenza seasons and 94,821 participants. The live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) showed significant protection against mismatched (six RCTs, VE 54\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 28\% to 71\%) and matched (seven RCTs, VE 83\%, 95\% CI 75\% to 88\%) influenza strains among children aged 6 to 36 months. Differences were observed between the point estimates for mismatched influenza A (five RCTs, VE 75\%, 95\% CI 41\% to 90\%) and mismatched influenza B (five RCTs, VE 42\%, 95\% CI 22\% to 56\%) estimates among children aged 6 to 36 months. The trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) also afforded significant protection against mismatched (nine RCTs, VE 52\%, 95\% CI 37\% to 63\%) and matched (eight RCTs, VE 65\%, 95\% CI 54\% to 73\%) influenza strains among adults. Numerical differences were observed between the point estimates for mismatched influenza A (five RCTs, VE 64\%, 95\% CI 23\% to 82\%) and mismatched influenza B (eight RCTs, VE 52\%, 95\% CI 19\% to 72\%) estimates among adults. Statistical heterogeneity was low (I2 {\textless}50\%) across all meta-analyses, except for the LAIV meta-analyses among children (I2 = 79\%). Conclusions: The TIV and LAIV vaccines can provide cross protection against non-matching circulating strains. The point estimates for VE were different for matching versus non-matching strains, with overlapping CIs.},

However, while this formulation seems sensible, its application to infectious disease can be diﬃcult to justify from ﬁrst principles. It has been shown from the seminal work of Bellman and Harris [2] that the renewal equation arises as the expectation of an age-dependent branching process. In this paper we provide a detailed derivation of the original Bellman Harris process. We introduce generalisations, that allow for time-varying reproduction numbers and the accounting of exogenous events, such as importations. We show how inference on the renewal equation is easy to accomplish within a Bayesian hierarchical framework. Using oﬀ the shelf MCMC packages, we ﬁt to South Korea COVID-19 case data to estimate reproduction numbers and importations. Our derivation provides the mathematical fundamentals and assumptions underpinning the use of the renewal equation for modelling outbreaks.},

Stringent control measures, such as school closures and stay-at-home orders, while having signiﬁcant effects, also bring huge economic losses. In the face of an emerging infectious disease, a crucial question for policymakers is how to make the trade-off and implement the appropriate interventions timely given the huge uncertainty. In this work, we propose a Multi-Objective Modelbased Reinforcement Learning framework to facilitate data-driven decision-making and minimize the overall long-term cost. Speciﬁcally, at each decision point, a Bayesian epidemiological model is ﬁrst learned as the environment model, and then the proposed model-based multi-objective planning algorithm is applied to ﬁnd a set of Pareto-optimal policies. This framework, combined with the prediction bands for each policy, provides a real-time decision support tool for policymakers. The application is demonstrated with the spread of COVID-19 in China.},

	abstract = {Epidemic models are useful tools in the fight against infectious diseases, as they allow policy makers to test and compare various strategies to limit disease transmission while mitigating collateral damage on the economy. Epidemic models that are more faithful to the microscopic details of disease transmission can offer more reliable projections, which in turn can lead to more reliable control strategies. For example, many epidemic models describe disease progression via a series of artificial 'stages' or 'compartments' (e.g. exposed, activated, infectious, etc.) but an epidemic model that explicitly tracks time since infection (TSI) can provide a more precise description. At present, epidemic models with 'compartments' are more common than TSI models , largely due to higher computational cost and complexity typically associated with TSI models. Here, however, we show that with the right discretization scheme a TSI model is not much more difficult to solve than a compartment model with three or four 'stages' for the infected class. We also provide a new perspective for adding 'stages' to a TSI model in a way that decouples the disease transmission dynamics from the residence time distributions at each stage. These results are also generalized for age-structured TSI models in an appendix. Finally, as proof-of-principle for the efficiency of the proposed numerical methods, we provide calculations for optimal epidemic control by non-pharmaceutical intervention.

All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workﬂow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workﬂow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison.

	abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has driven demand for forecasts to guide policy and planning. Previous research has suggested that combining forecasts from multiple models into a single “ensemble” forecast can increase the robustness of forecasts. Here we evaluate the real-time application of an open, collaborative ensemble to forecast deaths attributable to COVID-19 in the U.S.
Methods Beginning on April 13, 2020, we collected and combined one- to four-week ahead forecasts of cumulative deaths for U.S. jurisdictions in standardized, probabilistic formats to generate real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts. We evaluated the point prediction accuracy and calibration of these forecasts compared to reported deaths.
Results Analysis of 2,512 ensemble forecasts made April 27 to July 20 with outcomes observed in the weeks ending May 23 through July 25, 2020 revealed precise short-term forecasts, with accuracy deteriorating at longer prediction horizons of up to four weeks. At all prediction horizons, the prediction intervals were well calibrated with 92-96\% of observations falling within the rounded 95\% prediction intervals.
Conclusions This analysis demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts issued in April-July 2020 provided robust short-term predictions of reported COVID-19 deaths in the United States. With the ongoing need for forecasts of impacts and resource needs for the COVID-19 response, the results underscore the importance of combining multiple probabilistic models and assessing forecast skill at different prediction horizons. Careful development, assessment, and communication of ensemble forecasts can provide reliable insight to public health decision makers.},

	abstract = {We propose a deterministic model capturing essential features of contact tracing as part of public health non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate an outbreak of an infectious disease. By incorporating a mechanistic formulation of the processes at the individual level, we obtain an integral equation (delayed in calendar time and advanced in time since infection) for the probability that an infected individual is detected and isolated at any point in time. This is then coupled with a renewal equation for the total incidence to form a closed system describing the transmission dynamics involving contact tracing. We deﬁne and calculate basic and effective reproduction numbers in terms of pathogen characteristics and contact tracing implementation constraints. When applied to the case of SARS-CoV-2, our results show that only combinations of diagnosis of symptomatic infections and contact tracing that are almost perfect in terms of speed and coverage can attain control, unless additional measures to reduce overall community transmission are in place. Under constraints on the testing or tracing capacity, a temporary interruption of contact tracing may, depending on the overall growth rate and prevalence of the infection, lead to an irreversible loss of control even when the epidemic was previously contained.},

We compare the incremental effectiveness for four different distribution strategies at four different levels of vaccine availability, reflecting different income settings’ historical COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Our analysis indicates that the best strategy to reduce severe outcomes is to actively target high disease-risk individuals. This was true in every scenario, although the advantage was greatest for the middle-income-country availability assumptions, and relatively modest compared to a simple mass vaccination approach for rapid, high levels of vaccine availability. Ring vaccination, while generally the most effective strategy for reducing infections, ultimately proved least effective at preventing deaths. We also consider using age group as a practical, surrogate measure for actual disease-risk targeting; this approach still outperforms both simple mass distribution and ring vaccination.

            We also find that the magnitude of strategy effectiveness depends on when assessment occurs (
            e.g
            ., after delta vs. after omicron variants). However, these differences in absolute benefit for the strategies do not change the ranking of their performance at preventing severe outcomes across vaccine availability assumptions.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Accurately estimating the effective reproduction number (Rt) of a circulating pathogen is a fundamental challenge in the study of infectious disease. The fields of epidemiology and pathogen phylodynamics both share this goal, but to date, methodologies and data employed by each remain largely distinct. Here we present EpiFusion: a joint approach that can be used to harness the complementary strengths of each field to improve estimation of outbreak dynamics for large and poorly sampled epidemics, such as arboviral or respiratory outbreaks, and validate it for retrospective analysis. We propose a model of Rt that estimates outbreak trajectories conditional upon both phylodynamic (time-scaled trees estimated from genetic sequences) and epidemiological (case incidence) data. We simulate stochastic outbreak trajectories that are weighted according to epidemiological and phylodynamic observation models and fit using particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo. To assess performance, we test EpiFusion on simulated outbreaks in which transmission and/or surveillance rapidly changes and find that using EpiFusion to combine epidemiological and phylodynamic data maintains accuracy and increases certainty in trajectory and Rt estimates, compared to when each data type is used alone. Finally, we benchmark EpiFusion’s performance against existing methods to estimate Rt and demonstrate advances in efficiency and accuracy. Importantly, our approach scales efficiently with dataset size, including the use of phylogenetic trees generated from large genomic datasets. EpiFusion is designed to accommodate future extensions that will improve its utility, such as introduction of population structure, accommodations for phylogenetic uncertainty, and the ability to weight the contributions of genomic or case incidence to the inference.

            Author Summary
            Understanding infectious disease spread is fundamental to protecting public health, but can be challenging as disease spread is a phenomenon that cannot be directly observed. So, epidemiologists use data in conjunction with mathematical models to estimate disease dynamics. Often, combinations of different models and data can be used to answer the same questions – for example ‘traditional’ epidemiology commonly uses case incidence data (the number of people who have tested positive for a disease at a certain time) whereas phylodynamic models use pathogen genomic sequence data and our knowledge of their evolution to model disease population dynamics. Each of these approaches have strengths and limitations, and data of each type can be sparse or biased, particularly in rapidly developing outbreaks or lower-middle income countries. An increasing number of approaches attempt to fix this problem by incorporating diverse concepts and data types together in their models. We aim to contribute to this movement by introducing EpiFusion, a modelling framework that makes improvements on efficiency and temporal resolution. EpiFusion uses particle filtering to simulate epidemic trajectories over time and weight their likelihood according to both case incidence data and a phylogenetic tree using separate observation models, resulting in the inference of trajectories in agreement with both sets of data. Improvements in our ability to accurately and confidently model pathogen spread help us to respond to infectious disease outbreaks and improve public health.},

We contextualize our results using port arrivals data from San Francisco, 1850–1852, and from a selection of historically significant voyages, 1492–1918. We offer numerical estimates of introduction risk across historicallyrealistic journey times and ship population sizes, and show that steam travel and shipping regimes that involved frequent, large-scale movement of people both substantially increased risk of transoceanic pathogen circulation.},

	abstract = {The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic of great interest. In particular, neural differential equations (ANDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. ANDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. ANDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for ANDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.},

	abstract = {In May 2022, a cluster of mpox cases were detected in the UK that could not be traced to recent travel history from an endemic region. Over the coming months, the outbreak grew, with over 3000 total cases reported in the UK, and similar outbreaks occurring worldwide. These outbreaks appeared linked to sexual contact networks between gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, local health systems were strained, and therefore effective surveillance for mpox was essential for managing public health policy. However, the mpox outbreak in the UK was characterised by substantial delays in the reporting of the symptom onset date and specimen collection date for confirmed positive cases. These delays led to substantial backfilling in the epidemic curve, making it challenging to interpret the epidemic trajectory in real-time. Many nowcasting models exist to tackle this challenge in epidemiological data, but these lacked sufficient flexibility. We have developed a novel nowcasting model using generalised additive models to correct the mpox epidemic curve in England, and provide real-time characteristics of the state of the epidemic, including the real-time growth rate. This model benefited from close collaboration with individuals involved in collecting and processing the data, enabling temporal changes in the reporting structure to be built into the model, which improved the robustness of the nowcasts generated.},

In this work, we build four new text-based datasets to evaluate measurement tampering detection techniques on large language models. Concretely, given sets of text inputs and measurements aimed at determining if some outcome occurred, as well as a base model able to accurately predict measurements, the goal is to determine if examples where all measurements indicate the outcome occurred actually had the outcome occur, or if this was caused by measurement tampering. We demonstrate techniques that outperform simple baselines on most datasets, but don’t achieve maximum performance. We believe there is significant room for improvement for both techniques and datasets, and we are excited for future work tackling measurement tampering.},

INP consists of two components, a spatiotemporal surrogate model built upon Neural Process (NP) family and an acquisition function for active learning. For surrogate modeling, we develop Spatiotemporal Neural Process (STNP) to mimic the simulator dynamics. For active learning, we propose a novel acquisition function, Latent Information Gain (LIG), calculated in the latent space of NP based models. We perform a theoretical analysis and demonstrate that LIG reduces sample complexity compared with random sampling in high dimensions. We also conduct empirical studies on three complex spatiotemporal simulators for reaction diffusion, heat flow, and infectious disease. The results demonstrate that STNP outperforms the baselines in the offline learning setting and LIG achieves the state-of-the-art for Bayesian active learning.},

We then use an epidemiological model, in which observed absolute humidity conditions temper influenza transmission rates, to successfully simulate the seasonal cycle of observed influenza-related mortality. The model results indicate that direct modulation of influenza transmissibility by absolute humidity alone is sufficient to produce this observed seasonality. These findings provide epidemiological support for the hypothesis that absolute humidity drives seasonal variations of influenza transmission in temperate regions.},

This framework can also be easily adapted to allow for the presence of underreporting in the final observed count.

Intense B/Victoria activity was followed by circulation of genetically diverse A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that were also antigenically drifted. We measured vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the United States against illness from these emerging viruses.
Methods.  We enrolled outpatients aged ≥6 months with acute respiratory illness at 5 sites. Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using the test-negative design, we determined influenza VE by virus subtype/lineage and genetic subclades by comparing odds of vaccination in influenza cases versus test-negative controls.
Results.  Among 8845 enrollees, 2722 (31\%) tested positive for influenza, including 1209 (44\%) for B/Victoria and 1405 (51\%) for A(H1N1)pdm09. Effectiveness against any influenza illness was 39\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 32–44), 45\% (95\% CI: 37–52) against B/Victoria and 30\% (95\% CI: 21–39) against A(H1N1)pdm09-associated illness. Vaccination offered no protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with antigenically drifted clade 6B.1A 183P-5A+156K HA genes (VE 7\%; 95\% CI: –14 to 23\%) which predominated after January.
Conclusions.  Vaccination provided protection against influenza illness, mainly due to infections from B/Victoria viruses. Vaccine protection against illness from A(H1N1)pdm09 was lower than historically observed effectiveness of 40\%–60\%, due to lateseason vaccine mismatch following emergence of antigenically drifted viruses. The effect of drift on vaccine protection is not easy to predict and, even in drifted years, significant protection can be observed.},

            Modeling complements surveillance data to inform coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health decision making and policy development. This includes the use of modeling to improve situational awareness, assess epidemiological characteristics, and inform the evidence base for prevention strategies. To enhance modeling utility in future public health emergencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the Infectious Disease Modeling and Analytics Initiative. The initiative objectives are to: (1) strengthen leadership in infectious disease modeling, epidemic forecasting, and advanced analytic work; (2) build and cultivate a community of skilled modeling and analytics practitioners and consumers across CDC; (3) strengthen and support internal and external applied modeling and analytic work; and (4) working with partners, coordinate government-wide advanced data modeling and analytics for infectious diseases. These efforts are critical to help prepare the CDC, the country, and the world to respond effectively to present and future infectious disease threats.},

	abstract = {Background.  In the United States, it is recommended that healthcare providers offer influenza vaccination by October, if possible. However, if the vaccine’s effectiveness soon begins to wane, the optimal time for vaccination may be somewhat later. We examined whether the effectiveness of influenza vaccine wanes during the influenza season with increasing time since vaccination.
Methods.  We identified persons who were vaccinated with inactivated influenza vaccine from 1 September 2010 to 31 March 2017 and who were subsequently tested for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by a polymerase chain reaction test. Testconfirmed influenza was the primary outcome and days-since-vaccination was the predictor of interest in conditional logistic regression. Models were adjusted for age and conditioned on calendar day and geographic area. RSV was used as a negative-control outcome.
Results.  Compared with persons vaccinated 14 to 41 days prior to being tested, persons vaccinated 42 to 69 days prior to being tested had 1.32 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.11 to 1.55) times the odds of testing positive for any influenza. The odds ratio (OR) increased linearly by approximately 16\% for each additional 28 days since vaccination. The OR was 2.06 (95\% CI, 1.69 to 2.51) for persons vaccinated 154 or more days prior to being tested. No evidence of waning was found for RSV.
Conclusions.  Our results suggest that effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine wanes during the course of a single season. These results may lead to reconsideration of the optimal timing of seasonal influenza vaccination.},

	abstract = {Background.  In 2018, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI). However, there is little guidance regarding which treatments are cost-effective.
Methods.  We used a Markov model to simulate a cohort of patients presenting with an initial CDI diagnosis. We used the model to estimate the costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of different CDI treatment regimens recommended in the recently published 2018 IDSA guidelines. The model includes stratification by the severity of the initial infection, and subsequent likelihood of cure, recurrence, mortality, and outcomes of subsequent recurrences. Data sources were taken from IDSA guidelines and published literature on treatment outcomes. Outcome measures were discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
Results.  Use of fidaxomicin for nonsevere initial CDI, vancomycin for severe CDI, fidaxomicin for first recurrence, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for subsequent recurrence (strategy 44) cost an additional \$478 for 0.009 QALYs gained per CDI patient, resulting in an ICER of \$31 751 per QALY, below the willingness-to-pay threshold of \$100 000/QALY. This is the optimal, cost-effective CDI treatment strategy.
Conclusions.  Metronidazole is suboptimal for nonsevere CDI as it is less beneficial than alternative strategies. The preferred treatment regimen is fidaxomicin for nonsevere CDI, vancomycin for severe CDI, fidaxomicin for first recurrence, and FMT for subsequent recurrence. The most effective treatments, with highest cure rates, are also cost-effective due to averted mortality, utility loss, and costs of rehospitalization and/or further treatments for recurrent CDI.},

            Observational studies have consistently shown that influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) is lower for H3N2 relative to H1N1pdm09 and type B, and this is not entirely explained by antigenic match. The triad of virus, vaccine, and host immunity provides a framework to examine contributing factors. Antigenic evolution facilitates H3N2 immune escape, and increasing glycosylation of the hemagglutinin shields antigenic sites from antibody binding. Egg passage adaptation of vaccine viruses generates mutations that alter glycosylation, impair the neutralizing antibody response, and reduce VE. Complex host immune factors may also influence H3N2 VE, including early childhood imprinting and repeated vaccination, but their role is uncertain. Of the triad of contributing factors, only changes to the vaccine are readily achievable. However, it is unclear whether current licensed non–egg-based vaccines generate superior protection against H3N2. The optimal strategy remains to be defined, but newer vaccine technology platforms offer great potential.},

	abstract = {A variety of filtering methods enable the recursive estimation of system state variables and inference of model parameters. These methods have found application in a range of disciplines and settings, including engineering design and forecasting, and, over the last two decades, have been applied to infectious disease epidemiology. For any system of interest, the ideal filter depends on the nonlinearity and complexity of the model to which it is applied, the quality and abundance of observations being entrained, and the ultimate application (e.g. forecast, parameter estimation, etc.). Here, we compare the performance of six state-of-the-art filter methods when used to model and forecast influenza activity. Three particle filters—a basic particle filter (PF) with resampling and regularization, maximum likelihood estimation via iterated filtering (MIF), and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC)—and three ensemble filters—the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF), and the rank histogram filter (RHF)—were used in conjunction with a humidity-forced susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model and weekly estimates of influenza incidence. The modeling frameworks, first validated with synthetic influenza epidemic data, were then applied to fit and retrospectively forecast the historical incidence time series of seven influenza epidemics during 2003–2012, for 115 cities in the United States. Results suggest that when using the SIRS model the ensemble filters and the basic PF are more capable of faithfully recreating historical influenza incidence time series, while the MIF and pMCMC do not perform as well for multimodal outbreaks. For forecast of the week with the highest influenza activity, the accuracies of the six model-filter frameworks are comparable; the three particle filters perform slightly better predicting peaks 1–5 weeks in the future; the ensemble filters are more accurate predicting peaks in the past.},

In 2019, the World Health Organization forecasts a yearly occurrence of infections from 100 million to 400 million, the maximum number of dengue cases ever testiﬁed worldwide, prompting WHO to label the virus one of the world’s top ten public health risks. Dengue hemorrhagic fever can progress into dengue shock syndrome, which can be fatal. Dengue hemorrhagic fever can also advance into dengue shock syndrome. To provide accessible and timely supportive care and therapy, it is necessary to have indispensable practical instruments that accurately differentiate Dengue and its subcategories in the early stages of illness development. Dengue fever can be predicted in advance, saving one’s life by warning them to seek proper diagnosis and treatment. Predicting infectious diseases such as dengue is difﬁcult, and most forecast systems are still in their primary stages. In developing dengue predictive models, data from microarrays and RNA-Seq have been used signiﬁcantly. Bayesian inferences and support vector machine algorithms are two examples of statistical methods that can mine opinions and analyze sentiment from text. In general, these methods are not very strong semantically, and they only work effectively when the text passage inputs are at the level of the page or the paragraph; they are poor miners of sentiment at the level of the sentence or the phrase. In this research, we propose to construct a machine learning method to forecast dengue fever.},

	abstract = {Background: Influenza vaccine policies that maximise health benefit through efficient use of limited resources are needed. Generally, influenza vaccination programmes have targeted individuals 65 y and over and those at risk, according to World Health Organization recommendations. We developed methods to synthesise the multiplicity of surveillance datasets in order to evaluate how changing target populations in the seasonal vaccination programme would affect infection rate and mortality.
Methods and Findings: Using a contemporary evidence-synthesis approach, we use virological, clinical, epidemiological, and behavioural data to develop an age- and risk-stratified transmission model that reproduces the strain-specific behaviour of influenza over 14 seasons in England and Wales, having accounted for the vaccination uptake over this period. We estimate the reduction in infections and deaths achieved by the historical programme compared with no vaccination, and the reduction had different policies been in place over the period. We find that the current programme has averted 0.39 (95\% credible interval 0.34–0.45) infections per dose of vaccine and 1.74 (1.16–3.02) deaths per 1,000 doses. Targeting transmitters by extending the current programme to 5–16-y-old children would increase the efficiency of the total programme, resulting in an overall reduction of 0.70 (0.52–0.81) infections per dose and 1.95 (1.28–3.39) deaths per 1,000 doses. In comparison, choosing the next group most at risk (50–64-y-olds) would prevent only 0.43 (0.35–0.52) infections per dose and 1.77 (1.15–3.14) deaths per 1,000 doses.
Conclusions: This study proposes a framework to integrate influenza surveillance data into transmission models. Application to data from England and Wales confirms the role of children as key infection spreaders. The most efficient use of vaccine to reduce overall influenza morbidity and mortality is thus to target children in addition to older adults.},

	abstract = {Background Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology.
Methods and Findings 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible.
Conclusions To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite the significant disease burden of the influenza virus in humans, our understanding of the basis for its pronounced seasonality remains incomplete. Past observations that influenza epidemics occur in the winter across temperate climates, combined with insufficient knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza in the tropics, led to the perception that cool and dry conditions were a necessary, and possibly sufficient, driver of influenza epidemics. Recent reports of substantial levels of influenza virus activity and well-defined seasonality in tropical regions, where warm and humid conditions often persist year-round, have rendered previous hypotheses insufficient for explaining global patterns of influenza.
Objective: In this review, we examined the scientific evidence for the seasonal mechanisms that potentially explain the complex seasonal patterns of influenza disease activity observed globally.
Methods: In this review we assessed the strength of a range of hypotheses that attempt to explain observations of influenza seasonality across different latitudes and how they relate to each other. We reviewed studies describing population-scale observations, mathematical models, and ecological, laboratory, and clinical experiments pertaining to influenza seasonality. The literature review includes studies that directly mention the topic of influenza seasonality, as well as other topics we believed to be relevant. We also developed an analytical framework that highlights the complex interactions among environmental stimuli, mediating mechanisms, and the seasonal timing of influenza epidemics and identify critical areas for further research.
Conclusions: The central questions in influenza seasonality remain unresolved. Future research is particularly needed in tropical localities, where our understanding of seasonality remains poor, and will require a combination of experimental and observational studies. Further understanding of the environmental factors that drive influenza circulation also may be useful to predict how dynamics will be affected at regional levels by global climate change.},

	abstract = {Given a sample of genome sequences from an asexual population, can one predict its evolutionary future? Here we demonstrate that the branching patterns of reconstructed genealogical trees contains information about the relative fitness of the sampled sequences and that this information can be used to predict successful strains. Our approach is based on the assumption that evolution proceeds by accumulation of small effect mutations, does not require species specific input and can be applied to any asexual population under persistent selection pressure. We demonstrate its performance using historical data on seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus. We predict the progenitor lineage of the upcoming influenza season with near optimal performance in 30\% of cases and make informative predictions in 16 out of 19 years. Beyond providing a tool for prediction, our ability to make informative predictions implies persistent fitness variation among circulating influenza A/H3N2 viruses.
          ,
            When viruses multiply, they copy their genetic material to make clones of themselves. However, the genetic material in the clone is often slightly different from the genetic material in the original virus. These mutations can be caused by mistakes made during copying or by radiation or chemicals. Further mutations arise when the clones multiply, which means that, after many generations, there will be quite large differences in the genetic material carried by many members of the population. Most mutations have little or no effect on the ‘fitness’ of an individual - that is, on its ability to survive and multiply - but some mutations do have an influence.
            Some viruses, like seasonal influenza (flu) viruses, can mutate so rapidly that the most common strains change from year to year. This is why new flu vaccines are needed every year. To date most attempts to predict the evolution of seasonal flu viruses have focused on identifying specific features within the genetic sequences that might indicate fitness. However, such approaches require lots of information about the viruses, and this information is often not available.
            To address this problem, Neher, Russell and Shraiman have developed a more general method to predict fitness from virus genetic sequences. First, a ‘family tree’ for a virus population - which shows how each strain of the virus is related to other strains - was constructed by comparing the genetic sequences.
            The next step was based on the observation that as long as differences in fitness arise from the accumulation of multiple mutations, the branching structure of this family tree will bear a visible imprint of the natural selection process as it unfolds. Using this insight and methods borrowed from statistical physics, Neher et al. then analyzed the shape and branching pattern of the tree to work out the fitness of the different strains relative to each other.
            Neher et al. tested the method using historical influenza A virus data. In 16 of the 19 years studied, the family tree approach made meaningful predictions about which viruses were most likely to give rise to future epidemics. The ability to predict influenza virus evolution from tree shape alone suggests that influenza virus evolution may be more predictable than previously expected.},

New antigenic variants have a substantial selective advantage at the population level, but these variants are rarely selected within-host, even in previously immune individuals. Using a mathematical model, we show that the temporal asynchrony between within-host virus exponential growth and antibody-mediated selection could limit within-host antigenic evolution. If selection for new antigenic variants acts principally at the point of initial virus inoculation, where small virus populations encounter wellmatched mucosal antibodies in previously-infected individuals, there can exist protection against reinfection that does not regularly produce observable new antigenic variants within individual infected hosts. Our results provide a theoretical explanation for how virus antigenic evolution can be highly selective at the global level but nearly neutral within-host. They also suggest new avenues for improving influenza control.},

	abstract = {Background: Since the outset of the COVID-­19 pandemic, substantial public attention has focused on the role of seasonality in impacting transmission. Misconceptions have relied on seasonal mediation of respiratory diseases driven solely by environmental variables. However, seasonality is expected to be driven by host social behavior, particularly in highly susceptible populations. A key gap in understanding the role of social behavior in respiratory disease seasonality is our incomplete understanding of the seasonality of indoor human activity.
Methods: We leverage a novel data stream on human mobility to characterize activity in indoor versus outdoor environments in the United States. We use an observational mobile app-­based location dataset encompassing over 5 million locations nationally. We classify locations as primarily indoor (e.g. stores, offices) or outdoor (e.g. playgrounds, farmers markets), disentangling location-­ specific visits into indoor and outdoor, to arrive at a fine-­scale measure of indoor to outdoor human activity across time and space.
Results: We find the proportion of indoor to outdoor activity during a baseline year is seasonal, peaking in winter months. The measure displays a latitudinal gradient with stronger seasonality at northern latitudes and an additional summer peak in southern latitudes. We statistically fit this baseline indoor-­outdoor activity measure to inform the incorporation of this complex empirical pattern into infectious disease dynamic models. However, we find that the disruption of the COVID-­19 pandemic caused these patterns to shift significantly from baseline and the empirical patterns are necessary to predict spatiotemporal heterogeneity in disease dynamics.
Conclusions: Our work empirically characterizes, for the first time, the seasonality of human social behavior at a large scale with a high spatiotemporal resolutio and provides a parsimonious parameterization of seasonal behavior that can be included in infectious disease dynamics models. We provide critical evidence and methods necessary to inform the public health of seasonal and pandemic respiratory pathogens and improve our understanding of the relationship between the physical environment and infection risk in the context of global change.

	abstract = {While much effort has gone into building predictive models of the COVID-19 pandemic, some have argued that early exponential growth combined with the stochastic nature of epidemics make the long-term prediction of contagion trajectories impossible. We conduct two complementary studies to assess model features supporting better long-term predictions. First, we leverage the diverse models contributing to the CDC repository of COVID-19 USA death projections to identify factors associated with prediction accuracy across different projection horizons. We find that better long-term predictions correlate with: (1) capturing the physics of transmission (instead of using black-box models); (2) projecting human behavioral reactions to an evolving pandemic; and (3) resetting state variables to account for randomness not captured in the model before starting projection. Second, we introduce a very simple model, SEIRb, that incorporates these features, and few other nuances, offers informative predictions for as far as 20-weeks ahead, with accuracy comparable with the best models in the CDC set. Key to the long-term predictive power of multi-wave COVID-19 trajectories is capturing behavioral responses endogenously: balancing feedbacks where the perceived risk of death continuously changes transmission rates through the adoption and relaxation of various Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs).},

	abstract = {Background: Influenza vaccine policies that maximise health benefit through efficient use of limited resources are needed. Generally, influenza vaccination programmes have targeted individuals 65 y and over and those at risk, according to World Health Organization recommendations. We developed methods to synthesise the multiplicity of surveillance datasets in order to evaluate how changing target populations in the seasonal vaccination programme would affect infection rate and mortality.
Methods and Findings: Using a contemporary evidence-synthesis approach, we use virological, clinical, epidemiological, and behavioural data to develop an age- and risk-stratified transmission model that reproduces the strain-specific behaviour of influenza over 14 seasons in England and Wales, having accounted for the vaccination uptake over this period. We estimate the reduction in infections and deaths achieved by the historical programme compared with no vaccination, and the reduction had different policies been in place over the period. We find that the current programme has averted 0.39 (95\% credible interval 0.34–0.45) infections per dose of vaccine and 1.74 (1.16–3.02) deaths per 1,000 doses. Targeting transmitters by extending the current programme to 5–16-y-old children would increase the efficiency of the total programme, resulting in an overall reduction of 0.70 (0.52–0.81) infections per dose and 1.95 (1.28–3.39) deaths per 1,000 doses. In comparison, choosing the next group most at risk (50–64-y-olds) would prevent only 0.43 (0.35–0.52) infections per dose and 1.77 (1.15–3.14) deaths per 1,000 doses.
Conclusions: This study proposes a framework to integrate influenza surveillance data into transmission models. Application to data from England and Wales confirms the role of children as key infection spreaders. The most efficient use of vaccine to reduce overall influenza morbidity and mortality is thus to target children in addition to older adults.},

The findings indicate that real-time skillful predictions of peak timing can be made more than 7 wk in advance of the actual peak. In addition, confidence in those predictions can be inferred from the spread of the forecast ensemble. This work represents an initial step in the development of a statistically rigorous system for real-time forecast of seasonal influenza.},

	abstract = {In this review, we have discussed the different statistical modeling and prediction techniques for various infectious diseases including the recent pandemic of COVID-19. The distribution fitting, time series modeling along with predictive monitoring approaches, and epidemiological modeling are illustrated. When the epidemiology data is sufficient to fit with the required sample size, the normal distribution in general or other theoretical distributions are fitted and the best-fitted distribution is chosen for the prediction of the spread of the disease. The infectious diseases develop over time and we have data on the single variable that is the number of infections that happened, therefore, time series models are fitted and the prediction is done based on the best-fitted model. Monitoring approaches may also be applied to time series models which could estimate the parameters more precisely. In epidemiological modeling, more biological parameters are incorporated in the models and the forecasting of the disease spread is carried out. We came up with, how to improve the existing modeling methods, the use of fuzzy variables, and detection of fraud in the available data. Ultimately, we have reviewed the results of recent statistical modeling efforts to predict the course of COVID-19 spread.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic programming has emerged as a powerful paradigm in statistics, applied science, and machine learning: by decoupling modelling from inference, it promises to allow modellers to directly reason about the processes generating data. However, the performance of inference algorithms can be dramatically affected by the parameterisation used to express a model, requiring users to transform their programs in non-intuitive ways. We argue for automating these transformations, and demonstrate that mechanisms available in recent modelling frameworks can implement noncentring and related reparameterisations. This enables new inference algorithms, and we propose two: a simple approach using interleaved sampling and a novel variational formulation that searches over a continuous space of parameterisations. We show that these approaches enable robust inference across a range of models, and can yield more efﬁcient samplers than the best ﬁxed parameterisation.},

Indeed, WHO, CDC, ECDC and the U.S. Institute of Medicine have prioritised understanding the modes of inﬂuenza transmission as a critical need for pandemic planning. Studying inﬂuenza transmission is difﬁcult; seasonality, unpredictable attack rates, role of environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity, numbers of participants required and confounding variables all present considerable obstacles to the execution of deﬁnitive studies. A range of investigations performed to date have failed to provide deﬁnitive answers and key questions remain. Reasons for this include the fact that many studies have not sought to investigate routes of transmission as a primary objective (instead, they have evaluated speciﬁc interventions) and that ﬁeldwork in natural settings, speciﬁcally assessing the dynamics and determinants of transmission between humans, has been limited. The available evidence suggests that all routes of transmission (droplet, aerosol and contact) have a role to play; their relative signiﬁcance will depend on the set of circumstances acting at a given time.

To address this, inﬂuenza vaccine content is reviewed annually to ensure protection is maintained, despite the emergence of drift variants; however, it is not always possible to capture every signiﬁcant drift, partly due to the timing of the recommendations. Vaccine mismatch can impact on vaccine effectiveness, and has signiﬁcant epidemiological and economical consequences, as was seen most apparently in the 1997–1998 inﬂuenza season. To meet the challenge of antigenic drift, vaccines that confer broad protection against heterovariant strains are needed against seasonal, epidemic and pandemic inﬂuenza.

            Coffee consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is not clear whether coffee consumption is related to CRC progression. Hence, we assessed the association of coffee consumption with CRC recurrence and all‐cause mortality using data from a prospective cohort study of 1719 stage I–III CRC patients in the Netherlands. Coffee consumption and other lifestyle characteristics were self‐reported using questionnaires at the time of diagnosis. We retrieved recurrence and all‐cause mortality data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the Personal Records Database, respectively. Cox proportional hazard regression models with and without restricted cubic splines were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking status, cancer stage and tumor location. We observed 257 recurrences during a 6.2‐year median follow‐up and 309 deaths during a 6.6‐year median follow‐up. Consuming more than 4 cups/d of coffee compared to an intake of {\textless}2 cups/d was associated with a 32\% lower risk of CRC recurrence (95\% CI: 0.49, 0.94,). The association between coffee consumption and all‐cause mortality was U‐shaped; coffee intake seemed optimal at 3–5 cups/d with the lowest risk at 4 cups/d (HR: 0.68, 95\% CI: 0.53, 0.88). Our results suggest that coffee consumption may be associated with a lower risk of CRC recurrence and all‐cause mortality. The association between coffee consumption and all‐cause mortality appeared nonlinear. More studies are needed to understand the mechanism by which coffee consumption might improve CRC prognosis.},

	abstract = {Background.  The antigenic distance hypothesis (ADH) predicts that negative interference from prior season’s influenza vaccine (v1) on the current season’s vaccine (v2) protection may occur when the antigenic distance is small between v1 and v2 (v1 ≈ v2) but large between v1 and the current epidemic (e) strain (v1 ≠ e).
Methods.  Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H3N2) illness was estimated by test-negative design during 3 A(H3N2) epidemics (2010–2011, 2012–2013, 2014–2015) in Canada. Vaccine effectiveness was derived with covariate adjustment across v2 and/or v1 categories relative to no vaccine receipt among outpatients aged ≥9 years. Prior vaccination effects were interpreted within the ADH framework.
Results.  Prior vaccination effects varied significantly by season, consistent with the ADH. There was no interference by v1 in 2010–2011 when v1 ≠ v2 and v1 ≠ e, with comparable VE for v2 alone or v2 + v1: 34\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = −51\% to 71\%) versus 34\% (95\% CI = −5\% to 58\%). Negative interference by v1 was suggested in 2012–2013 with insignificant reduction in VE when v1 ≈ v2 and v1 ≠ e: 49\% (95\% CI = −47\% to 83\%) versus 28\% (95\% CI = −12\% to 54\%). Negative effects of prior vaccination were pronounced and statistically significant in 2014–2015 when v1 ≡ v2 and v1 ≠ e: 65\% (95\% CI = 25\% to 83\%) versus −33\% (95\% CI = −78\% to 1\%).
Conclusions.  Effects of repeat influenza vaccination were consistent with the ADH and may have contributed to findings of low VE across recent A(H3N2) epidemics since 2010 in Canada.},

This paradigm has been useful in simplifying the biological reality of epidemics and has allowed the modelling community to focus on the complexity of other factors such as population structure and interventions. However, there is an increasing amount of evidence that the strain diversity of pathogens, and their interplay with the host immune system, can play a large role in shaping the dynamics of epidemics. Here, we introduce a disease model with an underlying genotype network to account for two important mechanisms. One, the disease can mutate along network pathways as it spreads in a host population. Two, the genotype network allows us to define a genetic distance between strains and therefore to model the transcendence of immunity often observed in real world pathogens. We study the emergence of epidemics in this model, through its epidemic phase transitions, and highlight the role of the genotype network in driving cyclicity of diseases, large scale fluctuations, sequential epidemic transitions, as well as localization around specific strains of the associated pathogen. More generally, our model illustrates the richness of behaviours that are possible even in well-mixed host populations once we consider strain diversity and go beyond the “one disease equals one pathogen” paradigm.},

Specifically, we discuss the computation and interpretation of the weighted interval score, which is a proper score that approximates the continuous ranked probability score.

The most severe measures to date include all restaurants, pubs and cafes being ordered to close on 20th March, followed by a “stay at home” order on the 23rd March and the closure of all non-essential retail outlets for an indefinite period. Government agencies are presently analysing how best to develop an exit strategy from these measures and to determine how the epidemic may progress once measures are lifted. Mathematical models are currently providing short and long term forecasts regarding the future course of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK to support evidence-based policymaking. We present a deterministic, age-structured transmission model that uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring hospital care and mortality to provide up-to-date predictions on epidemic spread in ten regions of the UK. The model captures a range of age-dependent heterogeneities, reduced transmission from asymptomatic infections and produces a good fit to the key epidemic features over time. We simulated a suite of scenarios to assess the impact of differing approaches to relaxing social distancing measures from 7th May 2020 on the estimated number of patients requiring inpatient and critical care treatment, and deaths. With regard to future epidemic outcomes, we investigated the impact of reducing compliance, ongoing shielding of elder age groups, reapplying stringent social distancing measures using region based triggers and the role of asymptomatic transmission. We find that significant relaxation of social distancing measures from 7th May onwards can lead to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 disease and the health system being quickly overwhelmed by a sizeable, second epidemic wave. In all considered age-shielding based strategies, we projected serious demand on critical care resources during the course of the pandemic. The reintroduction and release of strict measures on a regional basis, based on ICU bed occupancy, results in a long epidemic tail, until the second half of 2021, but ensures that the health service is protected by reintroducing social distancing measures for all individuals in a region when required. Our work confirms the effectiveness of stringent non-pharmaceutical measures in March 2020 to suppress the epidemic. It also provides strong evidence to support the need for a cautious, measured approach to relaxation of lockdown measures, to protect the most vulnerable members of society and support the health service through subduing demand on hospital beds, in particular bed occupancy in intensive care units.},

However, to date no models capable of capturing the diverse seasonal pattern in tropical and subtropical climates exist. In addition, multiple influenza viruses could cocirculate and shape epidemic dynamics. Here we construct seven mechanistic epidemic models to test the effect of two major climate drivers (humidity and temperature) and multi-strain co-circulation on influenza transmission in Hong Kong, an influenza epidemic center located in the subtropics. Based on model fit to long-term influenza surveillance data from 1998 to 2018, we found that a simple model incorporating the effect of both humidity and temperature best recreated the influenza epidemic patterns observed in Hong Kong. The model quantifies a bimodal effect of absolute humidity on influenza transmission where both low and very high humidity levels facilitate transmission quadratically; the model also quantifies the monotonic but nonlinear relationship with temperature. In addition, model results suggest that, at the population level, a shorter immunity period can approximate the co-circulation of influenza virus (sub)types. The basic reproductive number R0 estimated by the best-fit model is also consistent with laboratory influenza survival and transmission studies under various combinations of humidity and temperature levels. Overall, our study has developed a simple mechanistic model capable of quantifying the impact of climate drivers on influenza transmission in (sub)tropical regions. This model can be applied to improve influenza forecasting in the (sub)tropics in the future.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models have played a key role in understanding the spread of directly-transmissible infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as the effectiveness of public health responses. As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices show qualitative similarities to the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.},

	abstract = {While much effort has gone into building predictive models of the COVID-19 pandemic, some have argued that early exponential growth combined with the stochastic nature of epidemics make the long-term prediction of contagion trajectories impossible. We conduct two complementary studies to assess model features supporting better long-term predictions. First, we leverage the diverse models contributing to the CDC repository of COVID-19 USA death projections to identify factors associated with prediction accuracy across different projection horizons. We find that better long-term predictions correlate with: (1) capturing the physics of transmission (instead of using black-box models); (2) projecting human behavioral reactions to an evolving pandemic; and (3) resetting state variables to account for randomness not captured in the model before starting projection. Second, we introduce a very simple model, SEIRb, that incorporates these features, and few other nuances, offers informative predictions for as far as 20-weeks ahead, with accuracy comparable with the best models in the CDC set. Key to the long-term predictive power of multi-wave COVID-19 trajectories is capturing behavioral responses endogenously: balancing feedbacks where the perceived risk of death continuously changes transmission rates through the adoption and relaxation of various Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs).},

	abstract = {Levels of sociality in nature vary widely. Some species are solitary; others live in family groups; some form complex multi-family societies. Increased levels of social interaction can allow for the spread of useful innovations and beneficial information, but can also facilitate the spread of harmful contagions, such as infectious diseases. It is natural to assume that these contagion processes shape the evolution of complex social systems, but an explicit account of the dynamics of sociality under selection pressure imposed by contagion remains elusive. We consider a model for the evolution of sociality strategies in the presence of both a beneficial and costly contagion. We study the dynamics of this model at three timescales: using a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model to describe contagion spread for given sociality strategies, a replicator equation to study the changing fractions of two different levels of sociality, and an adaptive dynamics approach to study the long-time evolution of the population level of sociality. For a wide range of assumptions about the benefits and costs of infection, we identify a social dilemma: the evolutionarily-stable sociality strategy (ESS) is distinct from the collective optimum—the level of sociality that would be best for all individuals. In particular, the ESS level of social interaction is greater (respectively less) than the social optimum when the good contagion spreads more (respectively less) readily than the bad contagion. Our results shed light on how contagion shapes the evolution of social interaction, but reveals that evolution may not necessarily lead populations to social structures that are good for any or all.},

The spread of the disease has revealed major geographical heterogeneity because of regionally varying individual behaviour and mobility patterns, unequal meteorological conditions, diverse viral variants, and locally implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination roll-out. To support national and regional authorities in surveilling and controlling the pandemic in real-time as it unfolds, we here develop a new regional mathematical and statistical model. The model, which has been in use in Norway during the first two years of the pandemic, is informed by real-time mobility estimates from mobile phone data and laboratory-confirmed case and hospitalisation incidence. To estimate regional and time-varying transmissibility, case detection probabilities, and missed imported cases, we developed a novel sequential Approximate Bayesian Computation method allowing inference in useful time, despite the high parametric dimension. We test our approach on Norway and find that three-week-ahead predictions are precise and well-calibrated, enabling policy-relevant situational awareness at a local scale. By comparing the reproduction numbers before and after lockdowns, we identify spatially heterogeneous patterns in their effect on the transmissibility, with a stronger effect in the most populated regions compared to the national reduction estimated to be 85\% (95\% CI 78\%-89\%). Our approach is the first regional changepoint stochastic metapopulation model capable of real time spatially refined surveillance and forecasting during emergencies.},

	abstract = {Forecast evaluation is essential for the development of predictive epidemic models and can inform their use for public health decision-making. Common scores to evaluate epidemiological forecasts are the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and the Weighted Interval Score (WIS), which can be seen as measures of the absolute distance between the forecast distribution and the observation. However, applying these scores directly to predicted and observed incidence counts may not be the most appropriate due to the exponential nature of epidemic processes and the varying magnitudes of observed values across space and time. In this paper, we argue that transforming counts before applying scores such as the CRPS or WIS can effectively mitigate these difficulties and yield epidemiologically meaningful and easily interpretable results. Using the CRPS on log-transformed values as an example, we list three attractive properties: Firstly, it can be interpreted as a probabilistic version of a relative error. Secondly, it reflects how well models predicted the time-varying epidemic growth rate. And lastly, using arguments on variance-stabilizing transformations, it can be shown that under the assumption of a quadratic mean-variance relationship, the logarithmic transformation leads to expected CRPS values which are independent of the order of magnitude of the predicted quantity. Applying a transformation of log (x + 1) to data and forecasts from the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub, we find that it changes model rankings regardless of stratification by forecast date, location or target types. Situations in which models missed the beginning of upward swings are more strongly emphasised while failing to predict a downturn following a peak is less severely penalised when scoring transformed forecasts as opposed to untransformed ones. We conclude that appropriate transformations, of which the natural logarithm is only one particularly attractive option, should be considered when assessing the performance of different models in the context of infectious disease incidence.},

Producing accurate and actionable forecasts of infectious disease incidence at short and long time scales will improve public health response to outbreaks. However, scientists and public health officials face many obstacles in trying to create such realtime forecasts of infectious disease incidence. Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that annually infects over 400 million people worldwide. We developed a real-time forecasting model for dengue hemorrhagic fever in the 77 provinces of Thailand. We created a practical computational infrastructure that generated multi-step predictions of dengue incidence in Thai provinces every two weeks throughout 2014. These predictions show mixed performance across provinces, out-performing seasonal baseline models in over half of provinces at a 2 month horizon. Additionally, to assess the degree to which delays in case reporting make long-range prediction a challenging task, we compared the performance of our real-time predictions with predictions made with fully reported data. This paper provides valuable lessons for the implementation of real-time predictions in the context of public health decision making.},

While we found authoritative estimates for most expected transmission and disease severity parameters, some were lacking, and others had significant uncertainties. Moreover, most transmission parameters were not validated domestically or re-assessed over the course of the pandemic. Publicly available disease surveillance measures did grow appreciably in scope and resolution over time; however, their resolution with regards to specific populations and exposure settings remained limited. We identified 283 published epidemiological reports authored by investigators affiliated with U.S. governmental public health entities. Most reported on descriptive studies. Published analytic studies did not appear to fully respond to knowledge gaps or to provide systematic evidence to support, evaluate or tailor community mitigation strategies. The existence of epidemiological data gaps 18 months after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for more timely standardization of data collection practices and for anticipatory research priorities and protocols for emerging infectious disease epidemics.},

Current seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines have highly variable efﬁcacy, and thus attempts to develop broadly protective universal inﬂuenza vaccines with durable protection are under way. While much attention is given to the virus-related factors contributing to inconsistent vaccine responses, host-associated factors are often neglected. Growing evidences suggest that host factors including age, biological sex, pregnancy, and immune history play important roles as modiﬁers of inﬂuenza virus vaccine efﬁcacy. We hypothesize that host genetics, the hormonal milieu, and gut microbiota contribute to host-related differences in inﬂuenza virus vaccine efﬁcacy. This review highlights the current insights and future perspectives into host-speciﬁc factors that impact inﬂuenza vaccine-induced immunity and protection. Consideration of the host factors that affect inﬂuenza vaccine-induced immunity might improve inﬂuenza vaccines by providing empirical evidence for optimizing or even personalizing vaccine type, dose, and use of adjuvants for current seasonal and future universal inﬂuenza vaccines.},

Three key features common to many biological systems are temporal forcing, stochasticity and nonlinearity.

The study of disease dynamics has been amongst the most theoretically developed areas of mathematical biology; simple models have been highly successful in explaining the dynamics of a wide variety of diseases. Models of childhood diseases incorporate seasonal variation in contact rates due to the increased mixing during school terms compared to school holidays. This ‘binary’ nature of the seasonal forcing results in dynamics that can be explained as switching between two nonlinear spiral sinks. Finally, we consider the stability of the attractors to understand the interaction between the deterministic dynamics and demographic and environmental stochasticity.

Strains from these Inﬂuenza A and Inﬂuenza B viruses currently co-circulate in humans. Of these, strains associated with the H3N2 subtype are afﬁliated with severe inﬂuenza seasons. H3N2 inﬂuenza viruses pre-dominated during 3 of the last 5 quite severe inﬂuenza seasons.

Since their introduction to the human population in 1968, H3N2 Inﬂuenza viruses have rapidly evolved both genetically and antigenically in an attempt to escape host immune pressures. As a result, these viruses have added numerous N-linked glycans to the viral hemagglutinin (HA), increased the overall net charge of the HA molecule, changed their preferences in receptor binding, and altered the ability of neuraminidase (NA) to agglutinate red blood cells prior to host entry. Over time, these adaptations have made characterizing these viruses increasingly difﬁcult.

	abstract = {In this work, the disease spreading under SEIR framework (susceptible-exposedinfected-recovered) and agent-based model was investigated via discrete magnetic spin and Monte Carlo simulation. The defined systems were two-dimensional square-lattice-like, where the spins (representing susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered agents) were allocated on lattice sites. Taking flu-like disease as a case study, the latent period was fixed at a quarter of infectious period. Then, the system size, the spin population density, and the infectious period were varied to observe its influence on uninfected population. In the simulation, each spin was randomly allocated on the lattice and interacted with its first and second neighbouring spins for disease spreading. The magnetization profiles, representing normalized agents in each state, were recorded. From the results, good agreement between the simulation and real spreading results was qualitatively evident. The uninfected susceptible (survivor) results can be categorized into 2 distinct phases depending on the values of infectious periods. The critical infectious period, which separates low and high survivor phases, was then extracted and power-law scaled with the population density. With this scaling formalism, one can use for specifying the overcrowd situation that conveys epidemic to pandemic, which may benefit epidemiologists and government for future health related policies issuance and deployment.},

	abstract = {Significance
            We resolve conflicting results regarding mask wearing against COVID-19. Most previous work focused on mask mandates; we study the effect of mask wearing directly. We find that population mask wearing notably reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission (mean mask-wearing levels corresponding to a 19\% decrease in R). We use the largest wearing survey (n = 20 million) and obtain our estimates from regions across six continents. We account for nonpharmaceutical interventions and time spent in public, and quantify our uncertainty. Factors additional to mask mandates influenced the worldwide early uptake of mask wearing. Our analysis goes further than past work in the quality of wearing data–100 times the size with random sampling–geographical scope, a semimechanistic infection model, and the validation of our results.
          ,

              The effectiveness of mask wearing at controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission has been unclear. While masks are known to substantially reduce disease transmission in healthcare settings [D. K. Chu
              et al., Lancet
              395, 1973–1987 (2020); J. Howard

              et al., Science
              eabg6296 (2021)], studies in community settings report inconsistent results [H. M. Ollila
              et al.,
              medRxiv (2020); J. Brainard
              et al., Eurosurveillance
              25, 2000725 (2020); T. Jefferson
              et al., Cochrane Database Syst. Rev.
              11, CD006207 (2020)]. Most such studies focus on how masks impact transmission, by analyzing how effective government mask mandates are. However, we find that widespread voluntary mask wearing, and other data limitations, make mandate effectiveness a poor proxy for mask-wearing effectiveness. We directly analyze the effect of mask wearing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, drawing on several datasets covering 92 regions on six continents, including the largest survey of wearing behavior (



                    n
                    =



              20 million) [F. Kreuter

              https://gisumd.github.io/COVID-19-API-Documentation
              (2020)]. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, we estimate the effect of mask wearing on transmission, by linking reported wearing levels to reported cases in each region, while adjusting for mobility and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as bans on large gatherings. Our estimates imply that the mean observed level of mask wearing corresponds to a 19\% decrease in the reproduction number
              R
              . We also assess the robustness of our results in 60 tests spanning 20 sensitivity analyses. In light of these results, policy makers can effectively reduce transmission by intervening to increase mask wearing.},

The increasing use of mathematical models for epidemic forecasting has highlighted the importance of designing reliable models that capture the baseline transmission characteristics of specific pathogens and social contexts. More refined models are needed however, in particular to account for variation in the early growth dynamics of real epidemics and to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms at play. Here, we review recent progress on modeling and characterizing early epidemic growth patterns from infectious disease outbreak data, and survey the types of mathematical formulations that are most useful for capturing a diversity of early epidemic growth profiles, ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth dynamics. Specifically, we review mathematical models that incorporate spatial details or realistic population mixing structures, including meta-population models, individual-based network models, and simple SIR-type models that incorporate the effects of reactive behavior changes or inhomogeneous mixing. In this process, we also analyze simulation data stemming from detailed large-scale agent-based models previously designed and calibrated to study how realistic social networks and disease transmission characteristics shape early epidemic growth patterns, general transmission dynamics, and control of international disease emergencies such as the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic in West Africa.},

To better understand the impact of this immunity on epidemiological dynamics, we propose an epidemic model structured according to immunity level that can be applied in many different settings. Under biologically realistic hypotheses, we find that immunity alone never creates a backward bifurcation of the disease-free steady state. This does not rule out the possibility of multiple stable equilibria, but we provide two sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the endemic equilibrium, and show that these conditions ensure uniqueness in several common special cases. Our results indicate that the within-host dynamics of immunity can, in principle, have important consequences for populationlevel dynamics, but also suggest that this would require strong non-monotone effects in the immune response to infection. Neutralizing antibody titer data for measles is used to demonstrate the biological application of our theory.},

	abstract = {Final size relations are known for many epidemic models. The derivations are often tedious and difficult, involving indirect methods to solve a system of integro-differential equations. Often when the details of the disease or population change, the final size relation does not. An alternate approach to deriving final sizes has been suggested. This approach directly considers the underlying stochastic process of the epidemic rather than the approximating deterministic equations and gives insight into why the relations hold. It has not been widely used. We suspect that this is because it appears to be less rigorous. In this note we investigate this approach more fully and show that under very weak assumptions (which are satisfied in all conditions we are aware of for which final size relations exist) it can be made rigorous. In particular the assumptions must hold whenever integro-differential equations exist, but they may also hold in cases without such equations. Thus the use of integro-differential equations to find a final size relation is unnecessary and a simpler, more general method can be applied.},

Using data from all known human cases of these viruses, we show that an individual’s first IAV infection confers lifelong protection against severe disease from novel hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes in the same phylogenetic group. Statistical modeling shows protective HA imprinting is the crucial explanatory factor, providing 75\% protection against severe infection and 80\% protection against death for both H5N1 and H7N9. Our results enable us to predict age distributions of severe disease for future pandemics and demonstrate that a novel strain’s pandemic potential increases yearly when a group-mismatched HA subtype dominates seasonal influenza circulation. These findings open new frontiers for rational pandemic risk assessment.},

	abstract = {ObjectiveReview the impact of applying regular data quality checks to assess completeness of core data elements that support syndromic surveillance.IntroductionThe National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) is a community focused collaboration among federal, state, and local public health agencies and partners for timely exchange of syndromic data. These data, captured in nearly real time, are intended to improve the nation's situational awareness and responsiveness to hazardous events and disease outbreaks. During CDC’s previous implementation of a syndromic surveillance system (BioSense 2), there was a reported lack of transparency and sharing of information on the data processing applied to data feeds, encumbering the identification and resolution of data quality issues. The BioSense Governance Group Data Quality Workgroup paved the way to rethink surveillance data flow and quality. Their work and collaboration with state and local partners led to NSSP redesigning the program’s data flow. The new data flow provided a ripe opportunity for NSSP analysts to study the data landscape (e.g., capturing of HL7 messages and core data elements), assess end-to-end data flow, and make adjustments to ensure all data being reported were processed, stored, and made accessible to the user community. In addition, NSSP extensively documented the new data flow, providing the transparency the community needed to better understand the disposition of facility data. Even with a new and improved data flow, data quality issues that were issues in the past, but went unreported, remained issues in the new data. However, these issues were now identified. The newly designed data flow provided opportunities to report and act on issues found in the data unlike previous versions. Therefore, an important component of the NSSP data flow was the implementation of regularly scheduled standard data quality checks, and release of standard data quality reports summarizing data quality findings.MethodsNSSP data was assessed for the national-level completeness of chief complaint and discharge diagnosis data. Completeness is the rate of non- null values (Batini et al., 2009). It was defined as the percent of visits (e.g., emergency department, urgent care center) with a non-null value found among the one or more records associated with the visit. National completeness rates for visits in 2016 were compared with completeness rates of visits in 2017 (a partial year including visits through August 2017). In addition, facility-level progress was quantified after scoring each facility based on the percent completeness change between 2016 and 2017. Legacy data processed prior to introducing the new NSSP data flow were not included in this assessment.ResultsNationally, the percent completeness of chief complaint for visits in 2016 was 82.06\% (N=58,192,721), and the percent completeness of chief complaint for visits in 2017 was 87.15\% (N=80,603,991). Of the 2,646 facilities that sent visits data in 2016 and 2017, 114 (4.31\%) facilities showed an increase of at least 10\% in chief complaint completeness in 2017 compared with 2016. As for discharge diagnosis, national results showed the percent completeness of discharge diagnosis for 2016 visits was 50.83\% (N=36,048,334), and the percent completeness of discharge diagnosis for 2017 was 59.23\% (N=54,776,310). Of the 2,646 facilities that sent data for visits in 2016 and 2017, 306 (11.56\%) facilities showed more than a 10\% increase in percent completeness of discharge diagnosis in 2017 compared with 2016.ConclusionsNationally, the percent completeness of chief complaint for visits in 2016 was 82.06\% (N=58,192,721), and the percent completeness of chief complaint for visits in 2017 was 87.15\% (N=80,603,991).

The emergence of novel viruses, historically, has often been coupled with the disappearance of existing seasonal virus strains. Here, we propose that the elimination of seasonal strains during virus pandemics is a process mediated, at the population level, by humoral immunity. Speciﬁcally, we suggest that infection with a novel virus strain, in people previously exposed to inﬂuenza viruses, can elicit a memory B cell response against conserved hemagglutinin stalk epitopes and/or neuraminidase epitopes. The anti-stalk and/or anti-neuraminidase antibodies then act to diminish the clinical severity of disease caused by novel inﬂuenza viruses and to eliminate seasonal virus strains.},

This study compares the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches in forecasting infectious disease incidences across different countries and time intervals. We forecasted three diverse diseases: campylobacteriosis, typhoid, and Q-fever, using a wide variety of features (n = 46) from public datasets, e.g., landscape, climate, and socioeconomic factors. We compared autoregressive statistical models to two tree-based ML models (extreme gradient boosted trees [XGB] and random forest [RF]) and two DL models (multi-layer perceptron and encoder–decoder model). The disease models were trained on data from seven different countries at the region-level between 2009–2017. Forecasting performance of all models was assessed using mean absolute error, root mean square error, and Poisson deviance across Australia, Israel, and the United States for the months of January through August of 2018. The overall model results were compared across diseases as well as various data splits, including country, regions with highest and lowest cases, and the forecasted months out (i.e., nowcasting, short-term, and long-term forecasting). Overall, the XGB models performed the best for all diseases and, in general, tree-based ML models performed the best when looking at data splits. There were a few instances where the statistical or DL models had minutely smaller error metrics for speciﬁc subsets of typhoid, which is a disease with very low case counts. Feature importance per disease was measured by using four tree-based ML models (i.e., XGB and RF with and without region name as a feature). The most important feature groups included previous case counts, region name, population counts and density, mortality causes of neonatal to under 5 years of age, sanitation factors, and elevation. This study demonstrates the power of ML approaches to incorporate a wide range of factors to forecast various diseases, regardless of location, more accurately than traditional statistical approaches.},

To better understand drift, we used antihemagglutinin monoclonal Abs (mAbs) to sequentially select IAV escape mutants. Twelve selection steps, each resulting in a single amino acid substitution in the hemagglutinin globular domain, were required to eliminate antigenicity deﬁned by monoclonal or polyclonal Abs. Sequential mutants grow robustly, showing the structural plasticity of HA, although several hemagglutinin substitutions required an epistatic substitution in the neuraminidase glycoprotein to maximize growth. Selecting escape mutants from parental versus sequential variants with the same mAb revealed distinct escape repertoires, attributed to contextual changes in antigenicity and the mutation landscape. Since each hemagglutinin mutation potentially sculpts future mutation space, drift can follow many stochastic paths, undermining its unpredictability and underscoring the need for drift-insensitive vaccines.},

For example, the Hoskins study [Hoskins, T. W., Davis, J. R., Smith, A. J., Miller, C. L. \& Allchin, A. (1979)
              Lancet
              i, 33–35] concluded that repeat vaccination was not protective in the long term, whereas the Keitel study [Keitel, W. A., Cate, T. R., Couch, R. B., Huggins, L. L. \& Hess, K. R. (1997)
              Vaccine
              15, 1114–1122] concluded that repeat vaccination provided continual protection. We propose an explanation, the
              antigenic distance
              hypothesis, and test it by analyzing seven influenza outbreaks that occurred during the Hoskins and Keitel studies. The hypothesis is that variation in repeat vaccine efficacy is due to differences in antigenic distances among vaccine strains and between the vaccine strains and the epidemic strain in each outbreak. To test the hypothesis, antigenic distances were calculated from historical hemagglutination inhibition assay tables, and a computer model of the immune response was used to predict the vaccine efficacy of individuals given different vaccinations. The model accurately predicted the observed vaccine efficacies in repeat vaccinees relative to the efficacy in first-time vaccinees (correlation 0.87). Thus, the antigenic distance hypothesis offers a parsimonious explanation of the differences between and within the Hoskins and Keitel studies. These results have implications for the selection of influenza vaccine strains, and also for vaccination strategies for other antigenically variable pathogens that might require repeated vaccination.},

We propose a model that utilizes publicly available Google search data to estimate current influenza-like illness activity level. Our model outperforms all available Google-search–based real-time tracking models for influenza epidemics at the national level of the United States, including Google Flu Trends. Our model is flexible, self-correcting, robust, and scalable, making it a potentially powerful tool that can be used for estimation and prediction at multiple temporal and spatial resolutions for other social events.

            Accurate real-time tracking of influenza outbreaks helps public health officials make timely and meaningful decisions that could save lives. We propose an influenza tracking model, ARGO (AutoRegression with GOogle search data), that uses publicly available online search data. In addition to having a rigorous statistical foundation, ARGO outperforms all previously available Google-search–based tracking models, including the latest version of Google Flu Trends, even though it uses only low-quality search data as input from publicly available Google Trends and Google Correlate websites. ARGO not only incorporates the seasonality in influenza epidemics but also captures changes in people’s online search behavior over time. ARGO is also flexible, self-correcting, robust, and scalable, making it a potentially powerful tool that can be used for real-time tracking of other social events at multiple temporal and spatial resolutions.},

	abstract = {Influenza infects an estimated 9–35 million individuals each year in the United States and is a contributing cause for between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths annually. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza are common in temperate regions of the world, with highest incidence typically occurring in colder and drier months of the year. Real-time forecasts of influenza transmission can inform public health response to outbreaks. We present the results of a multiinstitution collaborative effort to standardize the collection and evaluation of forecasting models for influenza in the United States for the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 influenza seasons. For these seven seasons, we assembled weekly real-time forecasts of seven targets of public health interest from 22 different models. We compared forecast accuracy of each model relative to a historical baseline seasonal average. Across all regions of the United States, over half of the models showed consistently better performance than the historical baseline when forecasting incidence of influenza-like illness 1 wk, 2 wk, and 3 wk ahead of available data and when forecasting the timing and magnitude of the seasonal peak. In some regions, delays in data reporting were strongly and negatively associated with forecast accuracy. More timely reporting and an improved overall accessibility to novel and traditional data sources are needed to improve forecasting accuracy and its integration with real-time public health decision making.},

Results, based on in-depth systematic review, show the vital role of environmental factors in the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and many limitations of the epidemiologic models of prediction because of the complex interactions between the new viral agent SARS-CoV-2, environment and society that have generated variants and sub-variants with rapid transmission. The insights here are, whenever possible, to clarify these aspects associated with public health in order to provide lessons learned of health policy that may reduce risks of emergence and diffusion of new pandemics having negative societal impact.},

The approach grew out of specific analyses conducted during the pandemic, in particular, an analysis concerning the effects of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in reducing COVID-19 transmission in 11 European countries. The model parameterises the time-varying reproduction number Rt through a multilevel regression framework in which covariates can be governmental interventions, changes in mobility patterns, or other behavioural measures. Bayesian multilevel modelling allows a joint fit across regions, with partial pooling to share strength. This innovation was critical to our timely estimates of the impact of lockdown and other NPIs in the European epidemics: estimates from countries at later stages in their epidemics informed those of countries at earlier stages. Originally released as Imperial College Reports, the validity of this approach was borne out by the subsequent course of the epidemic. Our framework provides a fully generative model for latent infections and derived observations, including deaths, cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and seroprevalence surveys. In this article, we additionally explore the confounded nature of NPIs and mobility. Versions of our model were used by New York State, Tennessee, and Scotland to estimate the current epidemic situation and make policy decisions.},

Accurate forecasts for higher time horizons help to balance the power grid effectively and efﬁciently. Traditional forecasting techniques rely on physical weather parameters and complex mathematical models. However, these techniques are time-consuming and produce accurate results only for short forecast horizons. Deep Learning Techniques like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are employed to learn and predict complex varying time series data. However, LSTM networks are susceptible to poor performance due to improper conﬁguration of hyperparameters. This work introduces two new algorithms for hyperparameter tuning of LSTM networks and a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based data decomposition technique. This work also proposes an optimised workﬂow for training LSTM networks based on the above techniques. The results show a signiﬁcant ﬁtness increase from 81.20\% to 95.23\% and a 53.42\% reduction in RMSE for 90 min ahead forecast after using the optimised training workﬂow. The results were compared to several other techniques for forecasting solar energy for multiple forecast horizons.},

In particular, while a variety of relatively complex simulation models have reproduced the evolutionary dynamics of influenza, simpler models have given less satisfying descriptions of the patterns seen in data. Here, we develop a set of relatively simple deterministic models of the transmission dynamics of multi-strain pathogens which give increased biological realism compared with past work. We allow the intensity of cross-immunity generated against one strain given exposure to a different strain to depend on the extent of genetic difference between the strains. We show that the dynamics of this model are determined by the interplay of parameters defining the cross-immune response function and can include fully symmetric equilibria, self-organized strain structures, regular periodic and chaotic regimes. We then extend the model by incorporating transient strain-transcending immunity that acts as a density-dependent mechanism to lower overall infection prevalence and thus pathogen diversity. We conclude that while some aspects of the evolution of influenza can be captured by deterministic models, overall, the description obtainable using a purely deterministic framework is unsatisfactory, implying that stochasticity of strain generation (via mutation) and extinction needs to be captured to appropriately capture influenza dynamics.},

In this perspective article, we re-evaluate studies of influenza virus survival in aerosols, transmission in animal models and influenza incidence to show that the combination of temperature and RH is equally valid as AH as a predictor. Collinearity must be considered, as higher levels of AH are only possible at higher temperatures, where it is well established that virus decay is more rapid. In studies of incidence that employ meteorological data, outdoor AH may be serving as a proxy for indoor RH in temperate regions during the wintertime heating season. Finally, we present a mechanistic explanation based on droplet evaporation and its impact on droplet physics and chemistry for why RH is more likely than AH to modulate virus survival and transmission.},

            Renewal equations are a popular approach used in modelling the number of new infections, i.e., incidence, in an outbreak. We develop a stochastic model of an outbreak based on a time-varying variant of the Crump–Mode–Jagers branching process. This model accommodates a time-varying reproduction number and a time-varying distribution for the generation interval. We then derive renewal-like integral equations for incidence, cumulative incidence and prevalence under this model. We show that the equations for incidence and prevalence are consistent with the so-called back-calculation relationship. We analyse two particular cases of these integral equations, one that arises from a Bellman–Harris process and one that arises from an inhomogeneous Poisson process model of transmission. We also show that the incidence integral equations that arise from both of these specific models agree with the renewal equation used ubiquitously in infectious disease modelling. We present a numerical discretisation scheme to solve these equations, and use this scheme to estimate rates of transmission from serological prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and historical incidence data on Influenza, Measles, SARS and Smallpox.},

In the study of global catastrophic risk (GCR), one line of thinking posits that deep human history renders natural GCRs insignificant. Essentially, the fact that natural hazards did not cause human extinction at any previous time makes it unlikely that they would do so now. This paper finds flaws in this argument, refines the theory of natural GCR, analyzes the space of natural GCRs, and presents implications for decisionmaking and research. The paper analyzes natural climate change, natural pandemics, nearEarth objects (asteroids, comets, and meteors), space weather (coronal mass ejections, solar flares, and solar particle events), stellar explosions (gamma-ray bursts and supernovae), and volcanic eruptions. Almost all natural GCR scenarios involve important interactions between the natural hazard and human civilization. Several natural GCR scenarios may have high ongoing probability. Deep human history provides little information about the resilience of modern global civilization to natural global catastrophes. The natural GCRs should not be dismissed on grounds of deep human history. Work on natural GCRs should account for their important human dimensions. A case can even be made for abandoning the distinction between natural and anthropogenic GCR.},

	abstract = {Parameter estimation and associated uncertainty quantiﬁcation is an important problem in dynamical systems characterised by ordinary differential equation (ODE) models that are often nonlinear. Typically, such models have analytically intractable trajectories which result in likelihoods and posterior distributions that are similarly intractable. Bayesian inference for ODE systems via simulation methods require numerical approximations to produce inference with high accuracy at a cost of heavy computational power and slow convergence. At the same time, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN) offer tractability that can be utilized to construct an approximate but tractable likelihood and posterior distribution. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach, where Laplace-based Bayesian inference is combined with an ANN architecture for obtaining approximations to the ODE trajectories as a function of the unknown initial values and system parameters. Suitable choices of customized loss functions are proposed to ﬁne tune the approximated ODE trajectories and the subsequent Laplace approximation procedure. The effectiveness of our proposed methods is demonstrated using an epidemiological system with non-analytical solutions—the Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model for infectious diseases—based on simulated and real-life inﬂuenza datasets. The novelty and attractiveness of our proposed approach include (i) a new development of Bayesian inference using ANN architectures for ODE based dynamical systems, and (ii) a computationally fast posterior inference by avoiding convergence issues of benchmark Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. These two features establish the developed approach as an accurate alternative to traditional Bayesian computational methods, with improved computational cost.},

	abstract = {Background: The Taiwan CDC relied on the historical average number of disease cases or rate (AVG) to depict the trend of epidemic diseases in Taiwan. By comparing the historical average data with prediction markets, we show that the latter have a better prediction capability than the former. Given the volatility of the infectious diseases in Taiwan, historical average is unlikely to be an effective prediction mechanism.
Methods: We designed and built the Epidemic Prediction Markets (EPM) system based upon the trading mechanism of market scoring rule. By using this system, we aggregated dispersed information from various medical professionals to predict influenza, enterovirus, and dengue fever in Taiwan.
Results: EPM was more accurate in 701 out of 1,085 prediction events than the traditional baseline of historical average and the winning ratio of EPM versus AVG was 64.6 \% for the target week. For the absolute prediction error of five diseases indicators of three infectious diseases, EPM was more accurate for the target week than AVG except for dengue fever confirmed cases. The winning ratios of EPM versus AVG for the confirmed cases of severe complicated influenza case, the rate of enterovirus infection, and the rate of influenza-like illness in the target week were 69.6 \%, 83.9 and 76.0 \%, respectively; instead, for the prediction of the confirmed cases of dengue fever and the confirmed cases of severe complicated enterovirus infection, the winning ratios of EPM were all below 50 \%.
Conclusions: Except confirmed cases of dengue fever, EPM provided accurate, continuous and real-time predictions of four indicators of three infectious diseases for the target week in Taiwan and outperformed the historical average data of infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Background  US public health authorities use syndromic surveillance to monitor and detect public health threats, conditions, and trends in near real-time. Nearly all US jurisdictions that conduct syndromic surveillance send their data to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), operated by the US. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, current data sharing agreements limit federal access to state and local NSSP data to only multi-state regional aggregations. This limitation was a significant challenge for the national response to COVID-19. This study seeks to understand state and local epidemiologists’ views on increased federal access to state NSSP data and identify policy opportunities for public health data modernization.
Methods  In September 2021, we used a virtual, modified nominal group technique with twenty regionally diverse epidemiologists in leadership positions and three individuals representing national public health organizations. Participants individually generated ideas on benefits, concerns, and policy opportunities relating to increased federal access to state and local NSSP data. In small groups, participants clarified and grouped the ideas into broader themes with the assistance of the research team. An web-based survey was used to evaluate and rank the themes using fivepoint Likert importance questions, top-3 ranking questions, and open-ended response questions.
Results  Participants identified five benefit themes for increased federal access to jurisdictional NSSP data, with the most important being improved cross-jurisdiction collaboration (mean Likert = 4.53) and surveillance practice (4.07). Participants identified nine concern themes, with the most important concerns being federal actors using jurisdictional data without notice (4.60) and misinterpretation of data (4.53). Participants identified eleven policy opportunities, with the most important being involving state and local partners in analysis (4.93) and developing communication protocols (4.53).
Conclusion  These findings identify barriers and opportunities to federal-state-local collaboration critical to current data modernization efforts. Syndromic surveillance considerations warrant data-sharing caution. However, identified policy opportunities share congruence with existing legal agreements, suggesting that syndromic partners are closer to agreement than they might realize. Moreover, several policy opportunities (i.e., including state and local partners in data analysis and developing communication protocols) received consensus support and provide a promising path forward.},

            Infectious disease outbreaks recapitulate biology: they emerge from the multi-level interaction of hosts, pathogens, and environment. Therefore, outbreak forecasting requires an integrative approach to modeling. While specific components of outbreaks are predictable, it remains unclear whether fundamental limits to outbreak prediction exist. Here, adopting permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability, we study the predictability of a diverse collection of outbreaks and identify a fundamental entropy barrier for disease time series forecasting. However, this barrier is often beyond the time scale of single outbreaks, implying prediction is likely to succeed. We show that forecast horizons vary by disease and that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are likely mechanisms for differences in predictability. Our results highlight the importance of embracing dynamic modeling approaches, suggest challenges for performing model selection across long time series, and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.},

            In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have sought to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission by restricting population movement through social distancing interventions, thus reducing the number of contacts. Mobility data represent an important proxy measure of social distancing, and here, we characterise the relationship between transmission and mobility for 52 countries around the world. Transmission significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in 73\% of the countries analysed, but we found evidence of decoupling of transmission and mobility following the relaxation of strict control measures for 80\% of countries. For the majority of countries, mobility explained a substantial proportion of the variation in transmissibility (median adjusted R-squared: 48\%, interquartile range - IQR - across countries [27–77\%]). Where a change in the relationship occurred, predictive ability decreased after the relaxation; from a median adjusted R-squared of 74\% (IQR across countries [49–91\%]) pre-relaxation, to a median adjusted R-squared of 30\% (IQR across countries [12–48\%]) post-relaxation. In countries with a clear relationship between mobility and transmission both before and after strict control measures were relaxed, mobility was associated with lower transmission rates after control measures were relaxed indicating that the beneficial effects of ongoing social distancing behaviours were substantial.},

            European governments use non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control resurging waves of COVID-19. However, they only have outdated estimates for how effective individual NPIs were in the first wave. We estimate the effectiveness of 17 NPIs in Europe’s second wave from subnational case and death data by introducing a flexible hierarchical Bayesian transmission model and collecting the largest dataset of NPI implementation dates across Europe. Business closures, educational institution closures, and gathering bans reduced transmission, but reduced it less than they did in the first wave. This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them. Specifically, we find smaller effects for closing educational institutions, suggesting that stringent safety measures made schools safer compared to the first wave. Second-wave estimates outperform previous estimates at predicting transmission in Europe’s third wave.},

            Reporting specific modelling methods and metadata is essential to the reproducibility of ecological studies, yet guidelines rarely exist regarding what information should be noted. Here, we address this issue for ecological niche modelling or species distribution modelling, a rapidly developing toolset in ecology used across many aspects of biodiversity science. Our quantitative review of the recent literature reveals a general lack of sufficient information to fully reproduce the work. Over two-thirds of the examined studies neglected to report the version or access date of the underlying data, and only half reported model parameters. To address this problem, we propose adopting a checklist to guide studies in reporting at least the minimum information necessary for ecological niche modelling reproducibility, offering a straightforward way to balance efficiency and accuracy. We encourage the ecological niche modelling community, as well as journal reviewers and editors, to utilize and further develop this framework to facilitate and improve the reproducibility of future work. The proposed checklist framework is generalizable to other areas of ecology, especially those utilizing biodiversity data, environmental data and statistical modelling, and could also be adopted by a broader array of disciplines.},

There is some evidence from both simulations and empirical studies supporting the likely effectiveness of these measures, but their broad adoption by researchers, institutions, funders and journals will require iterative evaluation and improvement.

            In the absence of drugs and vaccines, policymakers use non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing to decrease rates of disease-causing contact, with the aim of reducing or delaying the epidemic peak. These measures carry social and economic costs, so societies may be unable to maintain them for more than a short period of time. Intervention policy design often relies on numerical simulations of epidemic models, but comparing policies and assessing their robustness demands clear principles that apply across strategies. Here we derive the theoretically optimal strategy for using a time-limited intervention to reduce the peak prevalence of a novel disease in the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered epidemic model. We show that broad classes of easier-to-implement strategies can perform nearly as well as the theoretically optimal strategy. But neither the optimal strategy nor any of these near-optimal strategies is robust to implementation error: small errors in timing the intervention produce large increases in peak prevalence. Our results reveal fundamental principles of non-pharmaceutical disease control and expose their potential fragility. For robust control, an intervention must be strong, early, and ideally sustained.},

Using a mechanistic model, we measured the extent to which population age distribution and heterosubtypic cross-immunity could explain the observed age patterns in Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam.

              The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put mathematical models in the spotlight.

Their analyses show that limited health care capacity in LMICs could counterbalance the benefits of a generally younger population. Unless these countries control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, high disease burdens are likely. This work adds to a growing corpus of disease modeling designed to inform and guide the pandemic response.},

The Omicron variant termed BA.2, which differs substantially from BA.1 based on genetic sequence, is currently replacing BA.1 in several countries, but its antigenic characteristics have not yet been assessed. Here, we used antigenic cartography to quantify and visualize antigenic differences between early SARS-CoV-2 variants (614G, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Zeta, Delta, and Mu) using hamster antisera obtained after primary infection. We first verified that the choice of the cell line for the neutralization assay did not affect the topology of the map substantially. Antigenic maps generated using pseudo-typed SARS-CoV-2 on the widely used VeroE6 cell line and the human airway cell line Calu-3 generated similar maps. Maps made using authentic SARS-CoV-2 on Calu-3 cells also closely resembled those generated with pseudo-typed viruses. The antigenic maps revealed a central cluster of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which grouped on the basis of mutual spike mutations. Whereas these early variants are antigenically similar, clustering relatively close to each other in antigenic space, Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 have evolved as two distinct antigenic outliers. Our data show that BA.1 and BA.2 both escape vaccine-induced antibody responses as a result of different antigenic characteristics. Thus, antigenic cartography could be used to assess antigenic properties of future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that emerge and to decide on the composition of novel spike-based (booster) vaccines.

              The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants continues to initiate fresh waves of COVID-19 infection across the globe. Antigenic cartography is an established method for assessing the degree of antigenic difference based on the capacity of polyclonal antibodies to distinct viral variants to neutralize an array of related viruses. Mykytyn
              et al.
              applied antigenic cartography to SARS-CoV-2 variants by generating hamster antisera to individual variants and assessing their ability to neutralize variants up to Omicron BA.2. This analysis revealed Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 as outlier variants that are quite different from each other and a cluster of earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants. Analysis of cross-neutralization via antigenic cartography may be of value in making decisions on updating the spike antigen are used in future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.},

A combined SEIR-SW model was built, to help understand the dynamics of infectious disease in a community, and to identify the main characteristics of epidemic transmission and its evolution over time. The model was also used to examine social network effects to better understand the topological structure of social contact and the impact of its properties. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the combined SEIR-SW model. Simulation results were analyzed to explore how network evolution inﬂuences the spread of desease, and statistical tests were applied to validate the model. The model accurately replicated the dynamic behavior of the real inﬂuenza epidemic data, conﬁrming that the susceptible size and topological structure of social networks in a human population signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the spread of infectious diseases. Our model can provide health policy decision makers with a better understanding of epidemic spread, allowing them to implement control measures.

            Influenza A viruses have caused a number of global pandemics, with considerable mortality in humans. Here, we analyse the time periods between influenza pandemics since 1700 under different assumptions to determine whether the emergence of new pandemic strains is a memoryless or history-dependent process. Bayesian model selection between exponential and gamma distributions for these time periods gives support to the hypothesis of history-dependence under eight out of nine sets of modelling assumptions. Using the fitted parameters to make predictions shows a high level of variability in the modelled number of pandemics from 2010–2110. The approach we take here relies on limited data, so is uncertain, but it provides cheap, safe and direct evidence relating to pandemic emergence, a field where indirect measurements are often made at great risk and cost.},

Hierarchical forecasting require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the coherency between different levels —the property that forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy. A fundamental limitation of prior research is the focus on forecasting the mean of each time series. We consider the situation where probabilistic forecasts are needed for each series in the hierarchy, and propose an algorithm to compute predictive distributions rather than mean forecasts only. Our algorithm has the advantage of synthesizing information from different levels in the hierarchy through a sparse forecast combination and a probabilistic hierarchical aggregation. We evaluate the accuracy of our forecasting algorithm on both simulated data and large-scale electricity smart meter data.

	abstract = {The proliferation and ubiquity of temporal data across many disciplines has generated substantial interest in the analysis and mining of time series. Clustering is one of the most popular data-mining methods, not only due to its exploratory power but also because it is often a preprocessing step or subroutine for other techniques. In this article, we present
              k
              -Shape and
              k
              -MultiShapes (
              k
              -MS), two novel algorithms for time-series clustering.
              k
              -Shape and
              k
              -MS rely on a scalable iterative refinement procedure. As their distance measure,
              k
              -Shape and
              k
              -MS use shape-based distance (SBD), a normalized version of the cross-correlation measure, to consider the shapes of time series while comparing them. Based on the properties of SBD, we develop two new methods, namely ShapeExtraction (SE) and MultiShapesExtraction (MSE), to compute cluster centroids that are used in every iteration to update the assignment of time series to clusters.
              k
              -Shape relies on SE to compute a single centroid per cluster based on all time series in each cluster. In contrast,
              k
              -MS relies on MSE to compute multiple centroids per cluster to account for the proximity and spatial distribution of time series in each cluster. To demonstrate the robustness of SBD,
              k
              -Shape, and
              k
              -MS, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation on 85 datasets against state-of-the-art distance measures and clustering methods for time series using rigorous statistical analysis. SBD, our efficient and parameter-free distance measure, achieves similar accuracy to Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a highly accurate but computationally expensive distance measure that requires parameter tuning. For clustering, we compare
              k
              -Shape and
              k
              -MS against scalable and non-scalable partitional, hierarchical, spectral, density-based, and shapelet-based methods, with combinations of the most competitive distance measures.
              k
              -Shape outperforms all scalable methods in terms of accuracy. Furthermore,
              k
              -Shape also outperforms all non-scalable approaches, with one exception, namely
              k
              -medoids with DTW, which achieves similar accuracy. However, unlike
              k
              -Shape, this approach requires tuning of its distance measure and is significantly slower than
              k
              -Shape.
              k
              -MS performs similarly to
              k
              -Shape in comparison to rival methods, but
              k
              -MS is significantly more accurate than
              k
              -Shape. Beyond clustering, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
              k
              -Shape to reduce the search space of one-nearest-neighbor classifiers for time series. Overall, SBD,
              k
              -Shape, and
              k
              -MS emerge as domain-independent, highly accurate, and efficient methods for time-series comparison and clustering with broad applications.},

	abstract = {We report on and evaluate the process and ﬁndings of a real-time modeling exercise in response to an outbreak of measles in Lola prefecture, Guinea, in early 2015 in the wake of the Ebola crisis. Multiple statistical methods for the estimation of the size of the susceptible (i.e., unvaccinated) population were applied to weekly reported measles case data on seven subprefectures throughout Lola. Stochastic compartmental models were used to project future measles incidence in each subprefecture in both an initial and a follow-up iteration of forecasting. Measles susceptibility among 1to 5-year-olds was estimated to be between 24\% and 43\% at the beginning of the outbreak. Based on this high baseline susceptibility, initial projections forecasted a large outbreak occurring over approximately 10 weeks and infecting 40 children per 1,000. Subsequent forecasts based on updated data mitigated this initial projection, but still predicted a signiﬁcant outbreak. A catch-up vaccination campaign took place at the same time as this second forecast and measles cases quickly receded. Of note, case reports used to ﬁt models changed signiﬁcantly between forecast rounds. Modelbased projections of both current population risk and future incidence can help in setting priorities and planning during an outbreak response. A swiftly changing situation on the ground, coupled with data uncertainties and the need to adjust standard analytical approaches to deal with sparse data, presents signiﬁcant challenges. Appropriate presentation of results as planning scenarios, as well as presentations of uncertainty and two-way communication, is essential to the effective use of modeling studies in outbreak response.},

Seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines also stand out for their variable effectiveness by age group from year to year and by recent vaccination status. These patterns suggest a role for immune history in inﬂuenza vaccine effectiveness, but inference is complicated by uncertainty about the contributions of bias to the estimates themselves. In this review, we describe unexpected patterns in the effectiveness of seasonal inﬂuenza vaccination and explain how these patterns might arise as consequences of study design, the dynamics of immune memory, or both. Resolving this uncertainty could lead to improvements in vaccination strategy, including the use of universal vaccines in experienced populations, and the evaluation of vaccine efﬁcacy against inﬂuenza and other antigenically variable pathogens.},

The difﬁculty stems from the remarkable ability of IAV to evade existing immunity. IAV’s error prone polymerase enables the rapid antigenic evolution of the two virion surface glycoproteins, neuraminidase and hemagglutinin (HA). Since the most potent antibodies (Abs) at neutralizing viral infectivity are directed the head of the HA, amino acid substitutions in this region enable IAV to evade Ab-based immunity. Here, we review recent progress in understanding how immunodominance, the tendency of the immune system to respond to foreign immunogens in a hierarchical manner, shapes IAV evolution.},

Bayesian SusceptibleInfected-Removed (SIR) models can be applied to the spatio-temporal spread of infectious diseases (STIFs) (such as COVID-19). In causal inference, it is classically of interest to investigate the counterfactuals. In the context of STIF, it is possible to use nowcasting to assess the possible counterfactual realization of disease in an incidence that would have been evidenced with no NPI. Classic lagged dependency spatio-temporal IF models are discussed, and the importance of the ST component in nowcasting is assessed. Real examples of lockdowns for COVID-19 in two US states during 2020 and 2021 are provided. The degeneracy in prediction over longer time periods is highlighted, and the wide conﬁdence intervals characterize the forecasts. For SC, the early and short lockdown contrasted with the longer NJ intervention. The approach here demonstrated marked differences in spatio-temporal disparities across counties with respect to an adherence to counterfactual predictions.},

	abstract = {Many computer models possess high-dimensional input spaces and substantial computational time to produce a single model evaluation. Although such models are often ‘deterministic’, these models suffer from a wide range of uncertainties. We argue that uncertainty quantification is crucial for computer model validation and reproducibility. We present a statistical framework, termed history matching, for performing global parameter search by comparing model output to the observed data. We employ Gaussian process (GP) emulators to produce fast predictions about model behaviour at the arbitrary input parameter settings allowing output uncertainty distributions to be calculated. History matching identifies sets of input parameters that give rise to acceptable matches between observed data and model output given our representation of uncertainties. Modellers could proceed by simulating computer models’ outputs of interest at these identified parameter settings and producing a range of predictions. The variability in model results is crucial for inter-model comparison as well as model development. We illustrate the performance of emulation and history matching on a simple one-dimensional toy model and in application to a climate model.

In this paper, the optimal vaccination strategy for a constrained time-varying SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered) epidemic model is solved under the frame of constrained optimal control problems. Three time-varying factors, i.e., seasonally varying incidence coefficient, monotonic decreasing successfully immune rate and monotonic increasing vaccine yield are considered. Constraints on vaccination rate, susceptible population and vaccine supply at each time instant, which are pure-control constraint, pure-state constraint and mixed state-control constraint, respectively, are all taken into consideration. The characterization for the optimal control is derived with the help of the Pontryagin’s maximum principle. And optimal control problems are successfully solved by a symplectic pseudospectral method numerically. Numerical results are consistent with the analytical ones. Finally, comparisons of different cases demonstrate that time-varying factors could alter the optimal vaccination strategy, which implies that omitting the time-varying factors may result in less optimal even unreasonable control strategy.},

Many aspects of ecological dynamics can only be understood when seasonality is included, ranging from the oscillations in the incidence of childhood diseases to the coexistence of species. Through several case studies, we outline what is now known about seasonality in an ecological context and set the stage for future efforts. We discuss various approaches and tools for incorporating seasonality in mathematical models. We argue, however, that these tools are still limited in scope and more easily-accessible approaches need to be developed.},

Here we begin with the basic building blocks of infectious disease epidemiology –the SIS and SIR type models – before considering the progress that has been made over the recent decades and the challenges that lie ahead. Throughout we focus on the understanding that can be developed from relatively simple models, although accurate prediction will inevitably require far greater complexity beyond the scope of this review. In particular, we focus on three critical aspects of infectious disease models that we feel fundamentally shape their dynamics: heterogeneously structured populations; stochasticity; and spatial structure.
